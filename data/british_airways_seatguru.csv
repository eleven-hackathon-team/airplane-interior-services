1612804327-639;https://www.seatguru.com/airlines/British_Airways/information.php;Boeing 777-300 (773);https://www.seatguru.com/airlines/British_Airways/British_Airways_Boeing_777_300.php;"- the layout is 2-4-2 which gives you a clue as to how cramped it has to be. This is purely a money-earning exercise by BA who just want the max £££'s from their business class customers, and blow their comfort

- the 2-4-2 firstly means the seats are very narrow, the legs part of the seats/bad area is narrower than the seat section to accommodate the shoulders/seat of the adjacent passenger.

- the narrow part means you can't sleep on your side, if that's what you do, as there's nowhere to bend your legs

- the aisle eats are very open and exposed to the aisle. In mid-flight with everyone sleepign it is an obstacle course to reach the loo as people's bedding is falling off, knees, elbows and feet are sticking out and I more than once woke someone by accident (not noticing feet with dark socks on for example). If you're in one of those seats, there is a draught every time a crew member passes - usually at a lick as they are understaffed and tryign to get round everyone asap.

- the in-seat faciliites are awful. There is one pathetic light, tucked under the lip of the partition and impossible to find except by asking a crew member. There is nowhere to put anything. There is a small drawer - at floor level, down by your feet. Also by that drawer as a mains socket and a USB socket. By your feet I reiterate. The drawer and sockets cannot be reached if the ""bed"" is reclined in sleeping position, or even if you just have the legs-up position, watchign a film or using the tray, etc

- the meal tray is pathetic - flimsy as all get-out, and not easy to fetch out from its hidey-hole

- the ""bed"" is short. Now, I am 6'6"" and always have a small bit of trouble on any flight or sleeper train journey, but most beds are 78"" or thereabouts. The BA 777 ones have to be somewhere between 72"" and 75"" at the most. I could nowhere near lie straight, nor due to the narrowness (as above) sleep on my side with my legs bent. Whilst I am above average height, there were plenty of other passengers somewhat crammed in to their beds, and I would imagine if you're more than say 6'1"" you are going to not be able to lie out flat, except for just 4 seats (16A,E,F,K)

- the ""flat bed"" is not. The backrest goes nowhere near flat.

- the 2-4-2 layour means to get to the central passengers the stewards have to lean right over the aisle passenger and access via a small space provided in the partition. Bad for the staff and bad for the aisle passenger.

- the central two passengers (centre 2 of the -4-) are shoulder to shoulder with no privacy whatsoever and a thoroughly inadequate divider screen. Sleeping (/trying to sleep) right next to a stranger like that is, as my wife said, like being back at Brownie's Camp, in a tent. If on the other hand it's the adjacent aisle passsenger you don't know, you spend the flight looking straight at them from not very far away at all, unless you put the screen up, whereupon the stewards can't get to you to hand you your meal.

- the piece de resistance is the obstacle course for inner 2 centre or window passengers to get out. If the aisle passenger is sleeping you actually have to CLIMB OVER them to get out, say to the loo. Physicaly possible (though still not acceptable!) if you've legs as long as mine, but if you're shorter, or have a gammy hip like my wife does, this is too hard and you're going to have to ""hold on"", or risk disturbing the aisle passenger

I absolutely don't know whatever possessed BA to accept this layout. They should have simply done a 1-2-1 angled layout like they have in 1st class, or like decent airlines use. Suffice to say that we will never ever consider a BA Club World flight. Our insurers also paid as much for this flight as we did for our return flights on Cathay, albeit they were booked well in advance; the point being though that BA don't reduce their Business Class price in compensation for such a terrible layout"

I can't understand why anyone would fly BA a second time.  We clearly will not be doing so.  The seat was cramped, had virtually no storage space,
required folks to step over you and the 
crew to pass food over you while serving other passengers.  I trust the plane's architect remains unemployed so that no further damage can be done by this incompetent designer.  If you sense I'm being a bit emotional try paying for a real business class experience and suffering through what doesn't even come close to what should be offered.  AVOID THIS AIRLINE UNTIL IT ADDRESSES ITS NUMEROUS DEFFICIENCES."

Like all comments I agree with the problem for seating. I am 6'3 and average build and have never been so uncomfortable. When the person in front puts their seat back there is no room to move and leg room is non existent. Be careful of your headphone cable, the AUX socket is in the side of the seat and I broke mine within a few hours due to the narrowness of the seat.

You can chat and you can eat together with one sitting on the foot rest, which you cannot do in Club. 

Be wary of seats 2D and 2E though. They are under the stairs up to the upper desk and can feel claustrophobic, made worse since you cannot see out of the windows on either side.

I would give these a ""yellow"" tag."

It does not lie completely flat: the unfolded seat provides 3/4 of the bed length with an adjustable foot rest added to that. The unfolded seat hinge area means that the small of your back has a rigid bar digging into it. The footrest can be set higher or lower than the unfolded seat which makes for uncomfortable legs. There is no accessible storage once the bed is open - so tricky if you need space for spectacles, water etc. you have to climb over a neighbouring bed to get out if you are in the window position. Our plane was formatted with WTplus in the nose area which meant that we had to queue with WT to board."

The recline is decent, the video screen excellent quality, and the upgraded Club quality food is fantastic.  The 787-8 windows are excellent, so get a window seat.  Downside is the footstool, which is useless if you are over 5'10.  Far too short.  Seat 10K is great choice.

The leg room seemed quite good (I'm 5""10 and there was space between my knees and the back of the seat in front, which is rare), but the seat itself is quite uncomfortable and my right leg kept on going numb, and with the new side lockers it isnt possible to lean against the side of the plane to sleep. Therefore, not the most comfortable plane for a long flight, and one of the rare occassions when I struggled to sleep. 
The noise in the cabin from the engines is minimal: one of the quietest flights I have ever taken. However, the down side of this is that you can hear ever sniff, cough, sneeze or snore: bring ear plugs!"

(We did get a hot breakfast when took off). My wife travelled a week later and was happy with the lie-flat bed again but the BA bed configuration means that its not suitable for tall people. Her lunch was a sandwich so lucky her! So in brief she recommends BA Business class for shorter people who dont like to eat much and dont need to go to the toilet for 7 hours as to get there you have to climb over your neighbour. (Alternatively you can pick an aisle seat but then you mustnt mind being disturbed for your neighbour to climb over you). Until BA sort this out you are better off using airlines like Thai Air with a much better seat pitch due to their business class layout.

When meals are being served, cabin crew have to pass it over your aisle neighbouring passenger. Worst of all if you want to leave your seat, you are required to climb over an aisle seat if they have reclined to sleep!!!
BA fares are generally more expensive than other airlines and in my view not worth it. I don't know who designed the seat layout but clearly they are trying to squueze in as many passengers as possible.

It's a long time since I flew BA Club World.  A recent BA flight from Muscat means I wilI not be repeating the experience in the near future.
The cabin layout is appalling.... 2-4-2 (compared to most airlines 1-2-1) is a joke. It is cramped and one has to ask if it was designed by the bean counters rather than customers. Not surprisingly there is absolutely no storage space. It feels like flying in a coffin !  I feel sorry for the Cabin crew having to lean over other passengers to serve food and drink. I understand the A380 layout is identical so obviously BA haven't learnt by their mistakes.
My meal was inedible (tenderloin of beef, a misnomer if ever there was) and when I returned it untouched the embarrassed crew member explained it had come out from Heathrow on the outbound flight.... no wonder it was tired and tough. My camel biryani in a local restaurant the night before was succulent and tender in comparison.
And they demand £300 to book seats !  
A quick look at TripAdvisor or Seat Guru confirms that my experience was not unusual.
So sad to think BA really was once 'the world's favourite airline'
I challenge Mr Walsh to fly Emirates and then attempt to defend his substandard product. If you have to fly BA choose Premium Economy.... the cabin and seating is much more attractive and you'll save money.... otherwise use their alliance members or Emirates/Qatar/Lufthansa/Singapore."

On my outbound flight from Montreal I had great trepidation after reading many of the comments. I was able to choose 39B (extreme port side seat with free space on the left hand side of the fuselage) which seemed to get positive reviews. Aside from the specific qualities of the seat due to its position, I found the width of the seat nothing out of the ordinary. I did not feel squeezed. the pitch was not great but once again not something that I found awful. Overall, a pretty decent seat and no noise or queues for the one rear toilet.

On the return flight I managed to get 39J and this was heaven as the other seat next to me - 39H - was unoccupied. Essentially the same as 39B."

Cushion width on my seat was 18"", which when combined with the fixed sides (armrest design) meant that I had to sit with my legs together for the whole flight.  Seat pitch is correct (38"") but huge IFE box is mounted under the seat in front (its about the size of a large shoe box) so only one leg has any legroom.  If you are of tiny stature (and very slim!) you will be able to twist your body to angle your legs to avoid the IFE box.  But then I guess you probably wouldnt need a PE seat in the first place :-)
Im 6'2"" and of average build (before you ask!).  I fly many times per year, but this was my first PE seat on a BA 747.  I have flown with many other airlines and have a good knowledge of economy and Premium economy seating.  For what its worth the BA747 PE seating is easily the worst seat I have ever paid for.  
BA also charge handsomely to sit with a fellow traveller (no free allocation in PE with BA), plus theres no lounge access etc etc.
All things considered, this was a really poor experience except for the cabin crew who were excellent.
To add insult to injury, my seat was also damaged and (in my opinion) unfit for service/purpose.  Have complained to BA via their survey but dont expect a response from them;  I had already written two complaints to them previously (prior to travel, regarding other issues) and didnt get a satisfactory response on those occasions either!

Despite how I might come across in my wording, Im a pretty laid back traveller thats easily pleased.  I think BA have many issues with their management's thinking, attitudes and policies.  This reflects poorly in the customer experience (except the flight/cabin crews, who I have always found to be excellent)"

So a very welcome new business class product, but it's a shame that it's taken BA so long to come up with this as they are so far behind most of their competitors (and undoubtedly it will take several years to refurbish the fleet)."

Sadly last year the Bearded Ones outfit discontinued its LHR  CPT route service, and my wife and I had to resort to BA for our annual winter break (one retirement benefit) in the Western Cape.  We were in seats 14 D & E outbound, and 14A & B (with broken foot rest) inbound.  Obviously the latter are preferable to the former.  These seats were adequate for us trim people; just as well as anyone bigger would have a problem getting out past a reclined seat in front of ones row.  BA markets its premium economy seats as World Traveller Plus.  Plus for sure right as this year in the absence of any competition BA has hiked its fares for WT+ in its tired old 747s (vs Virgins newer A340s), a small and fuzzy video screen (vs Vs larger and sharper) which system packed up in the WT+ section after thirty minutes outbound, and their outrageous additional charging for pre-booking ones seat (vs Vs free choice).  Boarding at CPT was chaotic and, as we saw no reason to Ryanair stampede, we waited for the crowd to thin out.  Consequently we and another couple were last to sit in WT+.  We might as well have been invisible.  After seeing another passenger being served her second glass of sparkling (BA call it champagne) I firmly requested service and we got it.  My wife and many annual swallows to the Western Cape are delighted that Thomas Cook Airlines is starting its LGW  CPT service in December using A330s.  I can again say, Never again, to BA."

In BA the Business class seating is 8 across - same as their premium economy.  In American it is 4.  In BA you always have to face another passenger literally a few feet away.

Unfortuntately, I feel that British Airways has fallen down on the job when it comes to business class.  Of all the international airlines, I have found that their business class tends to be the least comfortable.  The window seats are ok but they tend to feel locked in because you have to step over (wake-up) others to get to the aisle unless you are in 53A.  Because of the seating configuration, there tends to be a sense of confusion when boarding.  The service is still terrific like the old British Airways but the seating needs to be improved...  I feel that British Aiways needs to stop cramming people into these business cabins...

Economy on this aircraft to be avoided at all costs. I am 6ft and well built. There is absolutely no leg room and you are packed tighter than sardines. When the seat in front reclines the screen is 6 inches from your face and almost impossible to comfortably focus. You have to be quite slender to fully retract table and enjoy your meal. Otherwise it is quite uncomfortable. Shame on you BA. Put some thought into your future planes. Econimy fund a majority part of flights so lets make it a bit more comfortable. I will not be flying BA again and will be telling everyone to avoid at all costs!

The seat in front has a large metal box underneath it, coming right the way to the back of the seat and covering half the width, such that putting your right leg underneath the seat in front is impossible. It's also not possible to put it between the outside edge of the seat in front and the side of the plane, there's not enough space. The only option is to twist your entire body and stretch it out diagonally to the left, resting your shin uncomfortably on the corner of the metal box.

D/F seats suffer from the in flight entertainment boxes taking over a quarter of the available leg room. And yes, if the seat in front inclines, you have little choice but to put yours back too.

Cabin was noticeably quieter than older aircraft - but the downside of less engine hum is that the toilet flushing is much more intrusive, as are other peoples conversations. Despite the young age of the aircraft, the IFE headphone sockets were already wobbly/working badly, and with personal headphones the volume is uncomfortably loud, even on its lowest setting."

Seats were narrow and hard; I had a 'large' passenger sitting next to me in the middle seat, forcing me to lean outwards the entire flight (even with a normal sized neighbour, the seat width is less than the distance across my shoulders). Legroom was severely constrained by the IFE boxes. BA should never have squeezed a 3-3-3 seating arrangement into a 2-4-2 fuselage width. I have since been actively avoiding 787 aircraft for any flights. Not recommended if you are anything other than small framed, or sitting next to a child."

The additional storage space adjacent to the window is an excellent feature.  Also, as I am 6ft tall, the bulkhead in front is sufficiently far away to allow room for stretching the legs whilst supporting them on top of a small backpack.  The food and service was also excellent.  If using the toilets, I suggest going up to the front of the Business Class section at the top of the stairs as the toilet there is huge! compared to the normal toilets.

Limited space for legs and feet because there is a metal box on the lefthand side of the foot space.

This is a basic world traveller seat. The seats are shoddily constructed of cheap materials and offer very poor support. They reminded me of seats on some small puddle-jumpers. Very uncomfortable trip. The ride of the plane was pretty smooth though.

Main problem with fully reclined seats in front. In this position it makes itvirtually inpossible to be able to red as the seat back is so close.

  I'll concede the one point because I forgot to choose my seat online and no upgrades were available so I got stuck in the middle.  Nevertheless, the seat was so narrow that I could barely operate my eating utensils, the sound was distorted on my entertainment screen so that I wasn't able to watch anything, and like others have said, once the person in front of me reclined their seat I had maybe ten inches between that and my face.  
  The woman to my right was very obese and the seat clearly wasn't made with larger sized people in mind.  She literally had to shimmy her way out of the vice-grip that the two armrests held on her waist in order to exit the seat and use the facilities. From a selfish point of view, my right armrest was obviously out of play and I had to use the blanket to establish a makeshift armrest within my own seat to prevent my elbow from painfully pressing against the side of that right armrest since her fat was resting where our elbows should have been, further constraining my space.

Also there is a foot rest in front of your seat. If you need acess to the isle you may need to jump over someone elses foot rest. That may disturb the other person. If you use the bathroom a lot on planes maybe sit in 10 B. But the isle seats are less privete. It is right next to the isle and closer to the galley so it may be noisier.

The seat transforms into a full-flat bed which was comfortable. Seat 15a has the (big) advantage that you have free access to the seat, unlike the other windowseats where you have to step over your fellow passenger when going to the toilet. Also the forward-backward facing seats are a little awkward. You are confronted face to face with your neighbor. There is a screen that goes up but it can cause an uncomfortable feeling. IFE is great, big screen and big selection available. This seat is next to the toilet but you will not notice anything.

BA service people are all-around very nice - from check in to the lounge to the plane. However, after meal service I literally didn't see an attendant for about 3 hours or so in the cabin. Kind of weird. 

Food was solid. Would have been nice to be offered an extra drink for the last 6 hours of the flight -- I would have gladly paid for it. Upsell! 

Seat was nice with extra legroom. Electronics/screen + audio on a movie was absolutely horrible, easily one of the worst I've ever seen. Plane seemed old and dingy, a bit disappointing."

Not only was it very quiet but also very comfortable and was able to sleep well on the 11 hour overnight flight.  Also, you can exit the seat without having to climb over the person sitting next to you.  The additional storage in the bins next to the window are also a great bonus.  The service from the two dedicated stewards for the 20 passengers on the upper deck is first class and the meal selection also very good.  The only criticism I have of the older versions of this plane is the lack of modern power points and the need to use an American style adapter rather than a UK 3-pin plug.  However, the steward came to my rescue and lent me his own adapter for the duration of the flight.  Certainly would select this seat again if flying on this type of aircraft.

My biggest problem is it is too short when flat. With hard points at either end and very narrow at the knee area, it is just not possible for someone at 6 ft or more to lie flat without jamming legs. I woke up with sore calves from trying to lie down. Attendant asked if I had a good night and I told him I did not to which he admitted he had lots of complaints from tall but not excessively tall people. This does not happen on Virgin Atlantic in the Upper Class suites. I am not super tall but at 6'2"" I had a very poor night. It is significant enough that I will not use BA Business Class again if Virgin available. Additionally, the awkward nature of  facing the other passenger until underway (I routinely raised the privacy 'curtain' only for flight attendant to lower it even though stated on it ""Needs to be lowered for safety briefing"" ) and the lack of storage space takes away from the experience. Simply put, I switched to BA for airport preferences and now I will be back to Virgin. Big mistake BA."

The crumpled shopping magazine was torn with pages missing.  A previous pasenger's toiletries were still in the single storage drawer. All v. grubby and, notwithstanding age of aircraft, much of it avoidable if proper service standards observed.

As a further aggravation, passengers not seated in Business regularly opening the curtain to use the bathroom (in full view of flight crew) causing long queues to form. 

Not a flight/experience would wish to repeat.  BA Business class ticket price should reflect the age/state of the aircraft and service levels being provided.

In world traveller plus they bring drinks round before take off but on this occasion it was water and orange juice.  One woman asked why there was no sparkling wine offered to which she got the reply (as the stewardess was walking away), not any left as they only stock enough for the outbound flight.

The divider makes this window seat very private when it is up, but that can only happen in flight and makes service from the aisle very difficult for the FA. Also, there is clambering over outstretched legs to reach the aisle so I can see why people complain about this layout.

However. 60A is great - masses of storage space (much more that the aisle seats) and as mentioned above, very private when the screen is up. I also found the seat comfortable, the controls easy to use and the space very generous. Also, this is upstairs on a 747 which is a fabulous, quiet place to be for a ride across the pond. I would book a spot up here every time and the service from the 2 FAs for 20 people is spot on.
Having said that, I was traveling on a day flight of about 8 hours and I only travelled business on this one because there was a GREAT deal (about 200 more than Prem Econ) and there is no way I would pay 5 grand to do this. On an overnight maybe, but not a day flight so this was a nice treat.

I had a hostess who failed to crack a smile once during the flight whereas my wife had a star who was really pleasant and helpfull, why can't BA sort out these miserable ones, we pay a lot of money and a smile costs nothing?  I can't remember the food it was that forgetable.  The seats are fine but squeezing in 8 to a row really is a bit greedy.  If travelling as a couple I would definitely go for two middle seats.  

AS far as 1st Class is concerned we were very pleasantly surprised, we had just come back from KL Malay 1st Class (where there are 8 seats in 1st) and were worried that the cabin would be tight, actually it is but they just get away with it.  We had two middle seats but next time we would go for two window seats which are more spacious.  We thought the tasting menu was very good and applaud BA for trying this.  They do however continue to let themselves with pettiness, only champagne before takeoff because they won't pay the duty on other drinks!! 

All in all we felt there was a slight improvement from 6 months ago or maybe they've tried harder for the A380."

Economy on the Dreamliner was one of the worst transatlantic flights I've ever flown on.  I had 30C, which was bulk head. I was incredibly uncomfortable even with the extra leg room. I'm a medium frame guy and only 5'11'' and my hips were incredibly snug due to the immovable armrest.  It was impossible to get comfortable and even just shift in the seat.  I wish they would have had better seating because the plane was great...incredibly smooth take offs and landings and the air filtration system was amazing.  Again, even with these perks, i rather fly one of the older 777's to PHL.

For whatever reason, they've removed the tray tables from the seat in front and put them in the armrests.  This makes the armrest solid, wider, and immobile.  It also makes the seat somewhat narrower than otherwise.  A poor design and a real downgrade from the 787.  I understand that the 777 will soon be replaced on this route with the new A-350.

BA booked me on a flight from London to Salzburg the next morning, my luggage didn't arrive and caught up with me two days later in Munich. As far as the seats in business class they are a joke.  Very narrow, a small drawer to put things in, no shelve space, in order to extend the seat you have to lower another small seat in front of you that matches up to you seat when you extend it out.  Plus seats face front and back.

The flat beds should be a plus but, in most rows, four of the eight passengers (those in the window and center seats) must climb over sleeping fellow passengers to get access to an aisle. My aisle seat was left me feeling exposed and felt as if the seat had been tacked on to the center seats as an after-thought to increase revenue. The IFE screen was a small 10"" with a grainy picture quality and the headphones were extremely uncomfortable because they were too small to fit around the ear and so smashed the ear to the head. The food service appeared to have been designed for cost savings and the convenience of the crew and so came off feeling very much like coach. The main course filet of beef was miserably flavorless and over-cooked. And aside from the packaged sweets and chips, the food in the self-service area of the galley was uniformly stale to the point of being inedible. By contrast, my return flight on American Airlines was positively heavenly. Same model aircraft (777) but with a roomy 1-2-1 seating layout; all with direct aisle access. The IFE had a crystal clear 15"" screen and the excellent noise-canceling headphones were sized to surround the ear rather than smash it. The quality of the food service towered above BA. The main course beef filet was done to perfection and delicious."

Having said that, if you do travel on a 12F aircraft, 2K is an excellent seat for a lone traveller.  
Middle seats said to be good for couples, but gentlemen need to remember that they will need to change aisles to remove their partner's bag from the overhead locker.
Because of this we prefer two window seats, one behind the other and because of the risk of their being no 3/4K seats and, not being Gold Exec members, being blocked from pre-booking 1A/K, we always book 2A and 3A on any 777-200ER flight."

The in flight entertainment is individual screens. They are the older type touch screens, but adequate for viewing movies and flight information, and the selection offered was varied.

I actually don't blame BA for this (much) the aircraft seems to have been designed for the cheapest running cost to the airline. The body seemed very narrow for a modern plane, consequently the seats seem to have been designed for small people - they are not very comfortable. Fine for short haul - but nasty for 9 hours. I was in the centre seat (E) and do not agree about the metal boxes under the seats I did not find they impinged on what little leg room I did have.

This means that row 10 is a lot quieter than on a BA 777-200.  The galley forward of your seat is quiet (and better laid out).  The small larder ahead of the port-side door is ideal for a quick snack in between the meals.  The ""misaligned window"" actually gives you a very private personal cabin (and you still have two windows to look out of, slightly to the rear).  And, in conjunction with seat 10J, the two of you have a lovely Transatlantic meal. 

Coming back from Chicago, the same comments apply to seats 10A&B on this new BA 777-300.  They've got rid of those silly lampshades which used to hang down in Club World on the 777-200.

All in all, a useful evolution of the BA 777 fleet.

I was offered an upgrade to WT+ for a song and it was well worth it. The WT+ cabin is very small and feels relatively exclusive. These front row seats are great - tons of legroom, above even the regular seats in the cabin which are already good. It allows you to get up easily without disturbing your neighbor even from the middle seat. The seats are wide enough that you don't feel cramped. The TV comes out of the arm and I am impressed but the responsiveness and crispness of the IFE. There is also plenty of selection including new releases and classics. A great way to spend an 8 hour day flight if you don't want to splash for Club World. Well worth the couple hundred bucks upgrade fee. This plane was old as I say - the latch broke on the bassinet in front of us, none of the seatbelt/no smoking signs worked and there were alarming crashes and bangs during taxi.

My non-aisle arm ached even before takeoff, and I was in agony for all 11 hours (delayed, as was the return flight). I'm 5'8"" and not overweight, but I had both my elbows jammed into my sides for the entire flight in each direction. (Seat 21D coming back was no better.) The armrest is so narrow that not only can you not share it, if you do get to use it you can't rotate your elbow normally, so your arm and wrist start to ache. Miserable. Cramming people in like this seems like cynical, callous opportunism on BA's part. I vowed to spring for premium economy next time but the prices are crazy so I can't afford the option. Praying for competitors on this route soon that use the 8-across configuration."

Good amount of space, 2 windows and plenty of width. The only problem was that the tray table was a little difficult to open and close then the seat in front was fully reclined. The seat itself was not bad, if a little firm. One additional minor detail was that the remote for the IFE is stored in the armrest right by your leg so it was a little difficult to access and fairly easy to accidentally press a button if you weren't careful. Otherwise, the premium economy is well worth the upgrade if the price is right.

Worst seating plan for business of any major airline.

This World Traveller Plus seat is at the back on the left of the cabin with the toilets behind it, but it has its benefits. Due to the fact that on this 747 layout the WTP cabin is at the front of the plane just behind First, you are usually the first off the plane. Also, if you are thin enough you can get out of this window seat by going down the side and around the back of it without disturbing your neighbour. On the LHR Cape Town route it is the un-refurbished version of the 747 so it is a little dated and the TV screen is very small.

The angle of the seatbacks is such that it is virtually impossible to retrieve anything from your personal belongings under the seat in front of you without kneeling in the aisle.

Personally I would avoid 14J as its proximity to the closet was bothersome to the man who sat there.  The Club kitchen was somewhat disappointing as it didn't have a number of items listed in the menu.  The seat was comfortable although having the storage draw so low was problematic as it wasnt accessible once the seat was reclined.  As you could access my seat without troubling anyone else I was surprised that the crew lowered the privacy screen and reached over 14J whenever they wanted to pass me anything.

However, the 747-400s are getting very old and even BA's impressive fleet of A380s cannot replace them fast enough. The seats are very comfy since they are old cloth and padded well, but the recline doesn't work smoothly anymore and the kind elderly gentleman next to me received a tray table in the chest when the woman in the front accidentally slammed her seat back.

Food was OK, and service was cool and professional as usual for BA. Overall not a bad seat, on the trusty old Queen of the Skies but it is a weary plane all the same."

Some seats face forward, others backward. No place to set anything other than the tray. Even the arm rests are rounded. A small drawer is down at floor level. Cannot access it without getting out of your seat, but first must move the tray and the tv screen. Power ports are down there too. The bucket seats are a bit deep and pitched back enough making it hard to get out of the seat. The divider between passengers gets lowered with every service to the other person. Lie flat requires lowering and securing a footrest, which the other passenger must step over. No underseat storage for a purse or briefcase, so everything must go up above for takeoff and landing. All in all, a poorly designed business class.

Much less leg room than the same plane has on different routes with other airlines (e.g. Air France).

Sleep is important to me on TATL flights and the hard product is acceptable (but then Club World seats are good enough if you get the right one).  The main problem on a relatively short flight such as PHL-LHR is that the FAs wake up the entire cabin at the crack of dawn which means you've only enjoyed four hours of sleep on this route.  Then you get breakfast and a few hours' time to waste before finally landing.  Wish the flight were scheduled earlier.  Also the temp was hot but the FAs said there was nothing they could do about it because a woman behind me had complained that she felt chilly. Oh well.

First of all it is a no brainer to be upstairs at a window. 
1. It's quieter
2. You have 2FA for 20 and 2 toilets: ratios not matched downstairs
3. 2x2 not the dreaded 2-4-2
4. Big window boxes for your stuff

Aisles upstairs are bad though. First of all the overhead lockers are small and second the floor seems to be made of 2 mm thick aluminium so, being towards the centre, you rock up and down whenever a FA walks past. Being on the edge at a window reduces this oscillation.

So, what's best? Again a no brainer. 62AK and 64AK have direct aisle access. 64A in particular is a vast space because of the cot provision. It is never released even to Gold guest list members until check-in. Move like greased lightning.

Service is indeed variable. I once waited 2.5 hours for an offer of a drink during an evident 'marital' tiff between two male stewards that was clearly unprofessional. But overall they do their British best. Not Qatar or Cathay or even South African but vastly preferable to US carriers whose FA regard even premium passengers as unspeakable vermin."

My seat - which i affectionately referred to as ""the tomb"" i would not recommend for anyone who has any claustrophobia. i so did not enjoy this trip that i will specifically be looking to avoid the 380 from now on."

We were seated in the window and aisle. None of the armrests lift so there is no gain in space even by the window. As soon as we were allowed to move the two passengers in front of us reclines fully and promptly went to sleep. We were literally pinned into our seats all night while they expelled foul gas in their sleep. I had to use the bathroom 4x during the flight and inorder to get out I reclined my seat fully, and got chastised by the man behind me; then I rolled over onto my stomach, inched up on my seat to my knees and then had to straddle the middle armrest ( about 6"" ) one leg at a time to exit the row. Luckily I didn't have to wake my husband as he couldn't get comfortable enough to sleep. The flight attendants were so busy, we never caught one to have them intervene so we just endured the flight from hell. In addition to the farty pants in front, there was an airsick passenger opposite my husband adding to the cabin pollution and the man behind me snored, open mouthed all night and had hallitosis. That cabin smelled dreadful. The cabin is small, cramped and cannot be called 'premium' by any suggestion. Several calls to BA customer service resulted in holding on for long periods then being cut off. Ultimately 3 days later and many attempts I finally reached someone who said she would report my comments, but BA does not do more than that. I was offered an upgrade to Club World for about $12K. How special! BA should not allow the seats to recline so far back that it becomes the responsibility of a passenger to consider if their seat will squash someone. I think it's fair to assume the airline has measured out the space to be comfortable. A little air circulation would have been helpful too, but you have no control over that in PE.
Caution: Do not fly unless you get the front row, and then be considerate of your neighbors!"

Well, don't be like me because something happened and suddenly those so called ""empty seats"" got all booked up, including the seat next to me in 82A. The seat was cramped, they drew the curtain next to the galley, which also meant that everyone exited throwing the curtain back without regard to the fact that I was sitting right there - I nearly got poked in the eye TWICE by careless people - once by a flight attendant and another passenger. Very disappointed with BA in general over their service and it didn't help matters one bit that everyone kept going back to the galley. Steer clear of this seat!!"

There was very little cushioning so the seats were terribly hard, my knees were touching the seat in front (and we are not tall people), the middle seat has been expanded and the hard metal centrepiece of the middle now juts into the seats on either side. The old Club Europe seats were very comfortable - these new seats in the changed cabin configuration are absolutely awful - and they are certainly no better than the seats in economy. This is a backward step by British Airways and we will not, in future, travel in British Airways Club Europe to Malta.

Yes, the exit door protrudes a bit, but it's much less bothersome than having a seat in front of you. You can get up without disturbing two other people any time you want. The seat armrest is solid because of the tv screen, but that at least stops larger people from squishing you in.

I was very excited to take the Dreamliner and have the opportunity to fly on basically the most modern aircraft to enter service. The plane was beautiful, the crew were wonderful, as was the food and services. However, this is the end of my compliments for this seat and the dreamliner, mostly due to the seating configuration. The 9-9-9 high density config for this aircraft is a NIGHTMARE. The seats are very poorly designed and not very comfortable. In this seat, as it is an exit row, has limited space because of a piece of padding attached to the side just before the exit door. It reduces your ability to sit straight forward and have to twist into the middle seats space. This is further compounded by how narrow the seats are. Measure 17.3inches and see if your shoulders are narrower than that, if they are GREAT you will fit, if not, you will be very uncomfortable, especially if you have somebody beside you with the same or greater shoulder width. The seats are flush to the cabin wall, where other aircraft have a gap of 2-3"" from the curve of the bulkhead, NOT ON THIS PLANE. The dreamliner was designed for 2-4-2, but some airlines (such as this one) have decided to squeeze that extra seat in there. On top of that the seat pitch is only 31"" if your not in an exit row, this makes for a very uncomfortable flight. If you have legs longer than 34"" you are going to be cramped, if you have shoulders that are larger than 17"", do yourself a favour and buy a ticket in Economy Plus, or look at another airline, it JUST ISN'T WORTH IT.

Luckily my seat did not have the IFE box under the seat in front as this robs passengers of further legroom. The recline was ok on the seat and the adjustable headrest could be quite comfortable, if there was just another 2 inches of legroom. When the seat in front is reclined the IFE screen is in right your face. Choice of IFE was however very good. The headphone socket in the arm of the seat is very easily damaged due to the location, encroaching on your very valuable 17.5 inches and care is needed if the headphones are left plugged in when leaving your seat. I feel on any long haul flight the passengers in the window and center seat should be able to get out to use the bathroom without disturbing the other passengers in the row, a tight 31inch pitch makes this impossible. The seats are so narrow that eating next to any other passenger is very difficult as clashing elbows occur.  Getting up and moving around the economy cabin is a bit tight too as the aisles are very narrow. The flight was very cold and on this type of aircraft you have no control over the airlow to the seat. Dreamliner, you gotta get to sleep first and cramped conditions make that impossible too.

The British Airways crew in Club World was excellent, but and yes it's possible for passenger to lie flat on this zone (I'm 5'5"" female) but I made a little tour of third class (Premium Economy, right behind the curtain of my seat) and next time will go for that instead. Seat 13D comprises a narrow little cubicle that can be electronically made into a lie-flat seat that connects with a footstool. But if you've brought items to work on during the 10-hour flight (Kindle, small laptop, puzzle book, all of which I preferred to the IFE), there only place to store your items is in a little drawer under the seat. Accessing the drawer, the IFE screen, and the tray table all require a jumble of re-configuring the seat. In addition, someone had purchased a Business Class seat for her toddler, and the poor child was not at all happy; the crying and screaming from the child lasted for several hours, and I felt very sorry, but on the other hand, this dispelled the myth that buying a seat in Club World ensures a child-free change to sleep. Premium Economy looked more like what I was looking for: an oversize, conventional seat (i.e. no layers of panels, and more like a chair than a contraption), with plenty of recline and legroom. I wasn't impressed by the Club World food, either. The tea sandwiches were mostly big wedges of dry bread with a smear of strange-flavored filling. I ordered beef for the entrée, and it was dry, cooked well past well done. I did raid the Club World snack pantry, though, and enjoyed chips and chocolate. The Dreamliner is beautiful nonetheless: excellent air quality and overall design that reduces feeling of claustrophobia. Weather helped prevent turbulence, but 13D also contributed to a smooth flight because the seat is near the center of the plane."

The open-suite seat design had plenty of room for a long ocean-crossing flight.  The table was large enought that it could accommodate a tablet set up on it to watch a movie with plenty of room for your meal.  There were ample power sources to charge your devices with adapters for US and UK plugs. I found the UK plugs stayed in place better than the US did, which is the case on most every plane I've flown.  The 3-prong design gives them stability that you dont get from the double-prong US plug.  The best feature of this seat was the amount of storage it had at floor level.  I was able to put both my rolling carry-on bag, as well as my shoulder bag in the closet built into the divider separating the foot well/ottoman area of the suite from the aisle, meaning I never even used the overhead storage at all.  One thing I would note on the BA A380s is that the First Class bathrooms on the lower deck, while a bit above average in size, are nowhere near as large as the two Business Class bathrooms at the front of the plane on the upper deck, which are located on either side of the stairway.  They are incredibly spacious, have plenty of room for changing and are the largest I've encountered on any commercial plane.  Still, when it comes to roominess at your seat, the First Class open-suite offered on the BA A380 is excellent!

Seat width extremely narrow, it is impossible to get at anything in your pockets. Impossible to sleep because of the restricted dimensions of the seat. With regard to meals - why, on USA to London flights, is the choice always between curry (which I do not normally eat) and pasta which is always disgusting and like eating rubber and lies on the stomach for hours afterwards. So no real choice there. The positive factors are that the plane is very quiet and the lavatories pristine (which one would expect on a new aircraft).

There's ZERO storage space once you recline. The tiny drawer next to your feet is stupid. The location is ridicules. When your seat is in takeoff/landing position it’s hard to reach. The moment you recline, that drawer is out of reach and there’s nowhere to put your phone, headphones, water bottle, etc...
In lie flat position the seat turns into a decent bed, but its SHORT. I’m 187 cm (6’2) tall, and I couldn’t lie on my back with my feet straight. Had to bend or lie sideways. I’ve flown business before on AA and Iberia and had no problem lying with feet stretched all the way, so this was very disappointing.  
Service was good, so was the food.
But this 8 seats across configuration is the worst business class ever. Whoever invented it and whoever approved it should spend the rest of their days seating in those seats. Crammed up, unsafe, no privacy. I booked this ticket because it was the cheapest business class fare I could find. You get what you pay for.
Oh, and BA’s first class? That’s a business class seat on AA and many other airlines. It’s funny how sad BA is. They’ll FINALLY get their business class up to par with the rest of the industry later this year, but it’ll take years before all its planes will have it. Until then- no BA business class for me.

In addition, when the attendent serves the window passenger, the screen must be down and they have to reach across the aisle passenger.  Also, the window passenger has to step across the feet of the aisle passenger.  Not very passenger or attendent friendly.

However I would now pay £50 for it, if I was on this aircraft again. It has to be the best premium economy  seat on the BA fleet as it is the new design and has a full exit row legroom. As there are no toilets near it people do not congregate in the area in front of you either. Seat 22A was free so I was able to spread out and did not find it any colder by the door and there is no bulge sticking out from the door either (Unlike most 777 emergency exits) so it is also a great seat unlike seatguru suggests!

The IFE boxes are far too large and restrict legroom.  In addition, the underseat height is smaller than other aircraft -- my bag which fits upright on other aircraft has to lay on its side under these seats.  Further, there is only ONE support under the seats in front, between the aisle and middle seats, meaning that with the window seat you will share the underseat legroom with the middle seat occupant.  Only the aisle seat has its own, divided legroom area.

He reported that the legroom was wonderful but the seat is extremely narrow, as reported by others, because of the equipment in the armrest. He also asked for a blanket because it's cold in that zone, as expected in an emergency exit seat. He is a big guy, so I'd recommend this seat only for lean people. FYI, in order to reserve that seat (he had used American miles) we had to call American airlines and ask for the British Airways equivalent record locator. That info isn't available online. Once we had the BA locator, we could log on to BA website, manage flights, and pay to select a seat. It's not possible to pay to move ahead to another class, but within the reserved class, pretty much any type of seat is available far in advance if you're willing to pay.

Legroom is bad due to the famous ""metal box"" under the front seat. With the close proximity of the toilets, your hear every details of the marvellous sounds produced in these not-at-all-soundproofed cabinets. 
The aisle next to you is where the fairly long queue for the bathroom forms. People waiting do use the top of your seat as a standing armrest, much like a convenient bar counter for casual talk with your toilet companions, making 41G an ever shaking massage seat, which may sounds lovely but isn't a nice thing for a 10h night flight.
On top of that on this particular flight we were served dinner very late, due to a shortage of meals. Cabin crew was lovely but totally overwhelmed by the situation. Seat 41G already means you're going to have a meal at the very end of the service, but here we were already very sleepy when eventually the crew managed to find us something to eat. This led to an awkward situation where another crew member offered us an ""herbal tea for a good night of sleep"" as we were only starting with the starter salad of the meal.
In the end, I found that the seat design and cabin arrangement of this BA A380 were very bad. Even though the crew seemed very nice and professionnal, and the plane well handled and on time, we did not not comfortable in those seats.

I flew this plane To and from JFK (both on seat 29C) and on my outbound flight I was allowed to leave my bag in front of my feet but on the inbound flight the same bag was forbidden to lay there. 

This seat is very pleasant since there are no restrooms in fron of the cabin so no unpleasant sounds or people waiting in line right in front of your seat. the aisle in the smaller World Traveller cabin (rows 28-35) is also noticeable wider then the bigger World Traveller cabin in the back which also prevents the service cart from the cabin crew to bump into you. 

Now as for the legroom: if you recline your seat all the way to the back and stretch out your legs fully, you even have more space then in the World Traveller Plus seats.

Lastly: in the front of the main cabin, it does not get as cold as in the back. Even when we were flying over Canada: the people in the back all had their sweaters and blankets on, people in the front were sitting in a T-shirt.

This seat is truly one of the best seats in the best seats in WT (better then the bulkhead seats in the middle of the cabin)."

This is purely a money-earning exercise by BA who just want the max £££'s from their business class customers, and blow their comfort
- the 2-4-2 firstly means the seats are very narrow, the legs part of the seats/bed area is narrower than the seat section to accommodate the shoulders/seat of the adjacent passenger.
- the narrow part means you can't sleep on your side, if that's what you do, as there's nowhere to bend your legs
- the aisle seats are very open and exposed  to the aisle.  In mid-flight with everyone sleepign it is an obstacle course to reach the loo as people's bedding is falling off, knees, elbows and feet are sticking out and I more than once woke someone by accident (not noticing feet with dark socks on for example).  If you're in one of those seats, there is a draught every time a crew member passes - usually at a lick as they are understaffed and trying to get round everyone asap.
- the in-seat faciliites are awful.  There is one pathetic light, tucked under the lip of the partition and impossible to find except by asking a crew member.  There is nowhere to put anything.  There is a small drawer - at floor level, down by your feet.  Also by that drawer as a mains socket and a USB socket.  By your feet I reiterate.  The drawer and sockets cannot be reached if the ""bed"" is reclined in sleeping position, or even if you just have the legs-up position, watching a film or using the tray, etc
- the meal tray is pathetic - flimsy as all get-out, and not easy to fetch out from its hidey-hole
- the ""bed"" is short.  Now, I am 6'6"" and always have a small bit of trouble on any flight or sleeper train journey, but most beds are 78"" or thereabouts.  The BA 777 ones have to be somewhere between 72"" and 75"" at the most. I could nowhere near lie straight, nor due to the narrowness (as above) sleep on my side with my legs bent. Whilst I am above average height, there were plenty of other passengers somewhat crammed in to their beds, and I would imagine if you're more than say 6'1"" you are going to not be able to lie out flat, except for just 4 seats (15A/E/F/K)
- the ""flat bed"" is not.  The backrest goes nowhere near flat.
- the 2-4-2 layour means to get to the central passengers the stewards have to lean right over the aisle passenger and access via a small space provided in the partition.  Bad for the staff and bad for the aisle passenger.
- the central two passengers (centre 2 of the -4-) are shoulder to shoulder with no privacy whatsoever.  Sleeping right next to a stranger like that is, as my wife said, like being back at Brownie's Camp, in a tent.  If on the other hand it's the adjacent aisle passsenger you don't know, you spend the flight looking straight at them from not very far away at all, unless you put the screen up, whereupon the stewards can't get to you to hand you your meal.
- the piece de resistance is the obstacle course for inner 2 centre or window passengers to get out.  If the aisle passenger is sleeping you actually have to CLIMB OVER them to get out, say to the loo.  Physicaly possible (though still not acceptable!) if you've legs as long as mine, but if you're shorter, or have a gammy hip like my wife does, this is too hard and you're going to have to ""hold on"", or risk disturbing the aisle passenger"

The 3x3x3 arrangement is bad enough, but the biggest problem is the the lack of leg room. I'm 5' 9"" and there was 2"" of space between my knee and the seat in front. Then, the second the seatbelt light goes out, the guy in front decides to put his seat back on full recline. What does this mean? It means that when I put my 13"" Macbook (bought on purpose to allow me to work on planes & trains) I'm unable to open the screen to its natural position, and the only way to work is to 'open' the screen, and then rest the front of the laptop halfway up my stomach and lean over like Mr.Burns from The Simpsons(!) Putting the laptop issue aside, it also meant that unless you recline your own seat fully, watching a movie on the headrest screens is very, very uncomfortable. I also plugged in my own Bose Headphones (the standard ones provided are too uncomfortable) to find that the audio setting it simply too loud. I bore with it, but could have done with adjusting the volume down a notch. By doing so with the TV controls, there is either no sound, or VERY LOUD. In closing, and I can't think that can be coincidence, on my flight, there was at least two people close to me who got travel sick, including the poor lady across the row from me. She motioned for help, and when the stewardess arrived, she tried two different sickbags before managing to open one (after 2 mins of trying to get the things open), just as the poor passenger was sick into her hands. Had this been my first experience of long haul I would have quit flying altogether, luckily is wasn't my first, only my worst. In conclusion, avoid flying Economy on Dreamliner."

Both legs in WT+ (Premium Economy).
I love the old Queen of the skies and was really looking forward to the flight, in particular as this is the V1 version with WT+ seating forward of Club World.
I was to be very disappointed. This is a very, very tired old bird who BA seemingly are not investing in at all. The plastic surrounding the blind was coming away, the footrest (attached to the seat in front) did not go all the way down resulting in an uncomfortable seating position and the rest of the aircraft and area was just tatty. 
Despite BA insisting that the seat pitch is the same as the A380, it felt far more cramped, and much more like normal WT (Economy). Not helped by the Multimedia box and seat legs in exactly the wrong place to stretch out.
I feel if you pay for a service (at near-as-makes-no-difference twice the price of WT) with the word ""Premium"" in the title you should expect, well a premium product. This falls well short of the mark, so much so that our next trip across the Atlantic will be with BA's biggest rival, Virgin."

The galley is positioned in the middle of the 5 rows of Club, so there is constant noise throughout the cabin.  It would be fair to say that because the aircraft is quieter, seats close to the galley and toilets are going to feel noisier, but in this aircraft you can never be more than two rows away from the galley and toilets if you're in Club.  The Club World kitchen is an extension of the galley and is, in effect, in the cabin area, so seats 3B and 3D are adjacent to this.  They have just crammed too much into the space and even the crew look like they're constantly falling over each other. Just a horrible experience. I would avoid this aircraft at all cost.

Constant issue with BA is the food.  Seriously inedible for anyone with a reasonable palette.  Chicken was the finest breaded tire leather imaginable with mushy vegies and couscous with the consistency of baby food.  $4k for a 6hr plane ride from phl to ldn deserves better than this pathetic excuse for food.

There was no extra leg room, my knees where pushed against the seat in front for the entire 3.5 hr flight from Marrakech. Despite several letters to BA they were not prepared to offer any compensation. Advice would be not to bother booking Club if the flight is on a 319/320, in fact there in more leg room on Easyjet and Ryanair flights to Marrakech, and at a fraction of the price.

When passengers are in prone position for sleeping, the person in an adjacent seat has to climb over the outstretched legs of another, or be climbed over by another.

Their layout is 8 sets across where civilized airlines use 6 or even 4 across, resulting in extremely crowded and very uncomfortable seating. Combine that with the usual miserable English food offered, and you would be better off flying just about any other airline.

I think this has been under-stated in prior comments, but in the window seats you will lose approximately 40% of your (already severely limited) leg room due to the support of the seat in front of you, combined with the entertainment system box that sits inside of that.  If you want to extend your legs, you will be forced to sit at an angle the entire flight, and keep your legs glued together to avoid intruding on the space of the passenger in the middle seat. 40% less legroom - this is not an exaggeration.  Fortunately, I was traveling with family, so was able to put a small child in this seat, with my wife and I in the middle and aisle seats.  I'm not sure who gets paid to design these planes, but it is a truly terrible design.  Some have mentioned additional storage space on the side, but that is not true of the lower level seats. These window seats should all be labelled yellow.

Whilst the plane itself ahs great features such as the windows and toilets, BA's configuration of 9 seats across makes for a very cramped flight.  The seats are narrow and  if the person in front reclines then your face is in the monitor and it's difficult to get out the seat.

The plane (LGW to Antigua) was very old. The plastic wall cover parted, there was a gap, the window was so scratched from the outside that looking out wasnt enjoyable, the seats were dirty and smelled of years of not being cleaned. All the trays and the armrests were dirty, I used 3 wet wipes before it was cleaned. Again, the FA didnt do much about it, said sorry and that was it. (I have photos to show the state of the seats).

Because the trays had crayon markings all over it is obvious that BA deliberately assigns these seats to families with small children. 

The proximity of the lavatories were actually fine, the seats reclined, but because they are narrower than the other seats I would advise anyone against accepting/booking these seats.

I think BA have messed up big time with this economy layout on the 787. The interior feels cramped and cheap. Seats are nowhere near wide enough, especially for Trans-Atlantic. The entertainment system box under the seat in front just makes legroom even worse. The tray table is also flimsy, and would not adequately hold my laptop without it repeatedly sliding around. Also 31C is two rows back from the washrooms, which on this aircraft seem to repeatedly slam loudly when people exit the washroom - irritating and not a problem I have noticed before on other aircraft. 

The only positives are the variable tint windows, which are a nice feature and are nice and big. It is also a noticeably quieter cabin compared to other BA aircraft (maybe this is why the door slamming seemed worse). There is also a USB charging outlet in the seat in front of you (although I didn't try this).

Unfortunately, I will go out my way now to avoid this aircraft. Fortunately Toronto and Washington are not frequent routes for me. I would much rather be on a BA 777, or even an older 747-400.

What they neglected to mention was that there is a display box on the left side of the foot well. The result was that I could not straighten my left leg for the entire flight. As it was a window seat, I would have had to disturb my sleeping fellow passengers in order to get into the aisle to stretch my legs. The flight was fully booked, so a seat transfer was out of the question. Very disappointed with this seat, I suffer arthritis and was crippled by the end of the flight.

Note that from seat row 42-to the back, D-F there are no overhead bins. These are locked for safety equipment apparently, so unless you're the first down the back of the plane then most likely you'll not have anywhere for your bag. Seatguru need to note this fact

The underseat space is very tight as in flight entertainment boxes are mounted there. The seats are narrow and I bent my Bose headphone jack just by simply trying to move in my seat. But worst of all is how narrow the ailses are, get a window seat unless you constantly want to be knocked into by cabin crew, trolleys and fellow passengers. 

Maybe other airlines have the 789 better laid out but I was underwhelmed by the whole thing. 

Good point; nice quiet aircraft."

However, my enthusiasm soon waned! 

I was in window seat 27A and my gripes were as follows:-

1. I couldn't comfortably extend my left leg straight out in front of me, due to an obstruction caused by the base structure of the seat in front. I therefore had to sit with a twisted posture!

2. They seem to have changed the design of the WC doors, so instead of having soft closing concertina type doors, they now have single section doors that close with a loud thud. Very annoying if you're sitting next to the WC where I was!

3. Generally I felt that BA have crammed far to many seats in width ways with a 3x3x3 configuration in economy class. My window seat consequently seemed to be tucked up as close to the fuselage as they could get it, so it felt very cramped. On my return journey in a small Airbus, there was at least some 3"" of clearance between the seat and the fuselage, which felt much better.

4. By far and away the biggest issue for me however, was something not related to seat comfort. Right from the moment the tug started pushing the plane back until we were airborne with flaps fully retracted, there was this excruciating whine percolating throughout my area of the cabin. I had to put my fingers in my ears at one point to get some respite from the noise!

I suspect it had something to do with the flap hydraulic systems, because the same noise started again when the flaps were extended for landing and didn't stop until retracted again at the terminal. Very annoying!! Come on Boeing :-(

In summary then, I felt the whole Dreamliner experience was very disappointing and frankly I couldn't wait to get off. Just as well we flew back on an Airbus and no, before anyone asks, I'm not anti-Boeing, I love their aircraft normally."

Seats are too narrow; uncomfortable in flat bed position; have insufficient storage space; no foot rest in seating position; inadequate individual light and I could go on.  In both directions, I was pleased that I had chosen an aisle seat as the inside rear facing seats appeared difficult to get in and out of, especially when the flat bed was in use.  I had no complaints of the cabin service and food on the daytime flight from the UK but food was terrible on the overnight flight from US and service almost non-existent, but this is normal overnight.  The main reason I travel Business class is for comfort and there are many other airlines that provide it better than BA."

I certainly under-estimated it, despite being warned in the seat plan commentary.  Note that, although it looks as though you're near the loos, those are reserved for Club Class passengers, so you can't use them.  Whilst that means that you won't be bothered by people queuing for them, you do have to go through two sections of plane to reach your nearest loos, further back in the plane.

On the down side, the armrest betwen the two seats that I purchased does NOT come even close to being fully liftable to move it out of the way, so if you intend to raise the armrest and enjoy both seats, that is not a feasible option as the arm goes up only a short distance, leaving about a 30 degree part sticking out into your back.

In general the Dreamliner is noticeably more quiet (in the front anyway) than a 777, but I can't say I noticed the improved air quality. They need another toilet in Club, not least because the crew did little to deter the stream of WT+ passengers coming into Club to use the facilities. 
Compared to Asian and Middle Eastern airlines the Club seats are too narrow and thinly padded to compare.
Finally the internal furniture of the cabin creaks and groans badly in turbulence, and take-off/landing.No doubt it is lightweight and fuel efficient, but it sounds as if it is going to implode at any minute, and gives a cheap ambience to the cabin."

Seat was comfortable and I love the feeling of lying backwards - particularly at take off and landing. The food was satisfactory. I have had better on other airlines in business class. Entertainment was good - plenty of choice. Crew were super attentive. A380 is a pleasure to fly on - so quiet you dont relaise just how big the plane is. Will definitely use this option again

The seat has no storage either, which was particularly frustrating when you want to keep an ipad close, or have a book and paper handy.  No-one came to collect rubbish at any point during the flight(empty water bottles, tissues etc.) so i ended up having to throw these on the floor until I could use the bin in the bridge. They had run out of eye masks, not helpful when in such a seat as when other travellers go to the loo through the curtains the light hits the seat directly.  Incredibly warm flight as well. Sorry BA - this seats sucks!

Important to drink plenty of good wine and get fed before boarding and fill out the piece of paper that says maximise sleep and handing over to cabin crew.

I thought the service was good, even though this was the first time for some of the crew on a 380. Perhaps people who agree with me tend not to submit comments, which seem dominated by the crabby and discontented.  After a decade of using this route with BA the norm is polite helpful professional service. The food can be variable - the wine is always good.

Whilst BA was one of the first to introduce flat beds on Business Class, the cabins are now a bit dated. The backwards-forwards layout is a bit awkward, and the screens are relatively poor. 

On the plus side, I like the window seats - they provide a kind of mini private cabin, and 53K has the advantage of not needing to climb over someone to get out. (NB Lots of people complain about this - for me it is no great hassle as long as you are reasonably fit and agile, but probably not recommended for someone with mobility difficulties. 

If I was flying on a corporate tab, BA's offering is not as good as most major European or Asian major airlines. But often BA offers cheaper and more flexible fares in Business, and if a flat bed and sleep is the priority, BA is just fine."

Well great was my surprise. Firstly let me agree on a number of things - the layout is just horrible - whoever decided that was a good idea should be fired! Getting in and out was a pain and its difficult for the crew to serve you. Now for the plus i found the seat very comfortable and in no way cramped (I'm 6'4). The 787 is probably one of the best planes ever for me. My only suggestion would be to either get row 3 or 7 window so you can get in/out eadier or rather then have an isle seat

Plus points It is  flat and controls are quite good.
The seat is in 2 sections. The main part plus a tip up attached to the shell of the seat in front. If they line up fine but if the tip-up bit sags (as mine did) its not 100% level.
Getting out of this (and all window seats) means retracting the seat, getting the small section from upright to vertical position, the carefully climbing over the legs of the passenger in the next row. It takes a lot of effort to get it right, which I didn't manage. The herringbone arrangement on other airlines is far better."

Huge mistake.  First problem: seat cushion is not exactly flat. In other words, when butt is seated cushion inclines towards a direction making my body slightly incline. Result: I got minor back pain after 10 hours of journey in that seat.  Second problem: seat recliner button was not working. I tried to manually force the seat to go backwards but did not help. I slept in the upright position in that 10 hour journey. Third problem: entertainment system. Screen of my entertainment system was fuzzy and non-responsive to touch gestures. Any video I watch gets stuck and I had to get out of that video and get back in to watch it again. I've verified this with other passengers in my row and found that only my entertainment system was acting strange.

This flight was the most unpleasant for me. Plus was a little bit extra legroom. The seat was significantly narrow. Fortunately I had a slim mother next to me for most of the flight, but when her husband swapped seats toward the end we were bumping arms and shoulders most of the time. Their baby was in a cot, so this cut off the short cut to toilets that other passengers have commented on. Big negative for me is that BA has decided to remove the air outlets from above the seats, in economy anyway. The flight seemed warm and stuffy and I couldn't wait to leave. This was not the case in the Qantas version of the aircraft. Unless I can get Premium Economy, I'd probably avoid this aircraft and route in future.

A regular backpack will not fit under it, so you have to keep getting up to get things from the overhead.  In addition the BA touch screen on this plane barely worked, have to jam finger against it repeatedly, no doubt annoying for passenger whose seat-back it was.   When scrolling the arrows are at very edge of screen and you constantly get no press or else hit the right/leftmost item instead of the paging arrow.  On the other hand the toilets are distant enough so that is no problem even when people are queuing for them.  The comments on this site for this plane do not make clear that the two-seat arrangments on left and right of row 39 are GREAT seats - there is no divider so the aisle seat basically has TWO underseat storage widths free, while the window side has a largish gap between next seat and fuselage, and doubtless would also be allowed to use part of the huge space in front of the aisle seat.  Based on the comments I found here I chose 39F but you should always prefer the two-seat seats in that row (perhaps better than any other row if you don't mind being at back of plane).

They offered a mattress cover for your seat while lying down to sleep and 2 different blankets. The video offerings were excellent, and the airline staff pleasant and professional. On our return trip the dinner offering was absolutely delicious. They are trying to have contemporary food. All in all, we had an outstanding experience and would highly recommend BA in business. The only downside was the older 767 flight from Heathrow to Athens. Even in business the seats were hard and uncomfortable. We were in a A320 form Athens to Heathrow on return and they blocked the middle seat for business. Still quite comfortable and modern and the tea was great!  Good grades for BA.

The economy seats on the BA 787 are ridiculously tight.  The middle person is squeezed in so tightly they are practically immobile unless the other two people lean into the window or the aisle.  

Also I'm not sure who designed the seat for this plane but on the aisle seat the window side metal legs for the seat have an edge that isn't rounded at all.  It is amazingly uncomfortable to have pressing on your leg that whole flight and you won't have a choice because the underseat space is so narrow."

At the back of WT+ be prepared to miss out on pre take off drinks, no food choice as ran out of food, no alternative offered.
Reclining seats come so far back, why do passengers do this as son as they sit down, there is no need during daytime hours, sleeping yes. Cabin staff do not even as the offenders to put the seat up at meal service, so had a back rest in my face for 9 hour flight

There is a box on the floor on the isle seat that cramps your feet space. The seats are so narrow that you better know who's next to you or you will know after the 7 hours of rubbing elbows with them. When the traveler in the seat in front of you reclines, you have less than 12 inches between you and your screen if you don't recline. If the flight attendants forget to ask everyone to put their seatbacks up for the dinner bell like ours forgot to do, it will be virtually impossible to cut your food and try to get it into your mouth! Even if they do bring their seatback up, your elbow will be in your neighbors chest when you cut your meat. I thought we were being filmed for Candid Camera. This plane is a complete joke and it's all on us. BA is filling it's pockets with money for the extra seats it has installed at our inconvenience. They are not concerned about standard class so don't waste your money on pre booking a standard seat. Their all the same. Maybe if enough complain, like they have on this site, BA might listen.

It's a shame as the plane I flew over on to LHR was nice and comfortable and had the bigger screens as well.  That's the other thing, these screens are so old and barely work, esp the audio.

The overall area in Club World is slightly more cramped than in a 747 or 777.  Most noticeably, it feels narrower.  The plane is super quiet and the lower air pressure is a benefit.  Dimming windows only operate across your whole pod, not for single windows which can be irritating.  The biggest issue is with the VOD system.  If you have your own Bose or other noise cancelling kit, prepare to be deafened.  I was told by the crew that the BA headphones are rubbish and that the VOD is tuned to them. You can't turn the volume on a quality pair down below very loud. BA need to look into this ASAP.

This was slightly made up for by the lack of a seat support between the middle two seats, but as this was shared with a stranger it was a little awkward to sit comfortably. The galley is a few rows in front of these seats and the constant talking at normal volume throughout this night flight made it even harder to get any sleep.

Whilst it doesn't have a window immediately next to the seat there is a window in the emergency exit door a foot or so in front – just lean forward if you really want to look outside.
The seat has similar benefits to seat 22B, zero leg room issues even for the tallest of passengers, plus you are not in the isle getting disturbed by passers-by and you have something to lean against with the bit more shoulder width. The tip about the small floor vent is spot on – if too cool, just cover with a magazine or the cushion.

Having read the reviews on Seatguru, I had tried to avoid BA on my trip to Mexico, but the cost to avoid BA completely was becoming prohibitive.
I had booked seat 43C at online check-in hoping that the flight wouldn't be full and I might have the whole two seat row to myself. At boarding I was told that there was a problem with the seat and was assigned 31K instead. I don't remember ever feeling so cramped on a flight before, and that includes short haul and regional flights. The guy next to me wasn't particularly large, but I felt trapped in my own little cell. Eating required a finding new ways to use my arms and there was no way I was going to be able to reach down to take off my shoes. And I have to mention the box in the foot space. I have been flying with the same backpack for years and this is the first time I have not been able to fit it under the seat in front. I even tried to make it smaller by putting some things in the seat pocket, but this isn't very spacious; not even as wide as the seat. What makes the whole episode worse is that my BA flight EDI-LHR to fly to Mexico was on a 767. This eems the wrong way around to me.
If you have to fly with BA on this type, consider paying for a premium seat. As for me, well thanks to the good contributors to Seatguru, I arranged to fly with a different carrier home from Mexico."

BA Business class food is reasonable (not great) but then again so are their fares.  However, I found the crews to be terrific - best medium, long haul crews I have had in a long time.

Our first time in First. Concorde room was amazing beforehand. Comfort, service and food on board was incredible.

There is a large difference in comfort and I can only echo previous comments concerning restricted legroom due to the box under the seat and the entertainment screen being in your face if the person in front reclines (unless you recline also which is pretty impolite on a daytime flight). If you can get a good price recommend the upgrade.

This was a plane to replace the elderly BA767 BA had historically operated on the route. They have managed to replace it with a plane that gives the impression of being just as old! This is an expensive route but with no direct competition so BA can get away with giving is their worst planes. The problem with the premium configeration in this plane is that there are no designated lavatories so you have to use those in the main economy section. The seat fabric looks as through it comes from the 1980s and the inflight entertainment system looks as though it is out of the ark. All in all it is probably worth the inconvenience of flying via Miami to fly on more modern equipment.

This Economy Class seat offers comfortable space, a storage room at the window-side and quite some legroom (I am 184cm tall). The crew was friendly, but then I never had an unfriendly crew when travelling on BA, and the food, overall, was very good. And... believe me, I am the first to complain about airline food. There was a nice lunch, some small snacks in-between and another light meal before landing. The crew served drinks throughout the flight. I would and possibly will fly this BA aircraft anytime again. Nothing to complain about, except maybe the rather high costs involved, should you wish to pre-assign these upper deck seats (62 Swiss Francs, my currency).

The galley is not bothersome for a day flight and turbulence you may experience on this seat as one of the worst in case you encounter some due to its position.

Both aisle seats in the middle of the plan have obstructed leg room from the entertainment system.  there is barely enough room for your feet.  The center seat has all the leg room, as there is no box there.  Since the flight was almost empty, I moved to 18A.  ALthough there are entertainment boxes, there is no divider on the floor between the seats so there is a lot of room for your feet.  Once again, great service, food, drinks, entertainment.

It isn't so much the rear-facing seats, it's just the configuration of having to stare at the person opposite from when the partition is in the lower position.  You are basically looking right at your neighbor with no privacy.  This partition has to be lowered during take off, landing.  It is also lowered during inflight service.  If you are at a window seat, you sometimes get forgotten because the flight attendant can't really see you or an empty glass!  And certainly the center two seats on the lower level in Business Class gives zero privacy the entire time.  Nice new airplane, but really awkward seats on their A380. Next time I'll chose an asile seat on the upper level.

However if you are a small person and you recline seat, its very stiff and when you put it forward, it yanks you forward which is not only annoying for the person in the set a but also the person behind /next to you! First meal was okay, but second and third (that's right THIRD MEAL)weren't very nice and at the end of flight felt stuffed. Cabin crew were kind and Entertainment was good (even if the screen was a bit small)Overall, I would definitely fly BA again.

I was woken up by doors from the galley being slammed as the crew prepared for breakfast / arrival. Also the toilet behind the seat was very compact for changing into and out of the complimentary sleep wear. The front toilet in the upper deck of the A380 is much larger, and I seem to remember the First Class toilets on the BA B747 being larger than the B777.

You are cocooned by the window so it helps with privacy and noise, the food service and walking about of the attendants did not bother my sleep like it does otherwise in Business Class.  You can easily get up and move about without climbing over anyone.  The flat seat to knees with the fold-down foot rest was perfect, I am 6' and was able to stretch all the way out comfortably.  This was my favorite flat seat.  Two lavatories for this section is not enough, terrible lines the last hour of the flight.

The IFE box and the supports for the seats in front mean that there is very little foot room. There was not room for me to have my feet side by side. Eating the meal, with the seat ahead reclined was very difficult. The instruction to stow smaller items under the seat in front is a joke .. there is no space.

Boeing produce a plane called the Dreamliner and then BA installs so many seats in economy that it more like a nightmare. The crew were great, but encouraged people to comment on the lack of space."

I was allocated seat 58F and quite honestly I was very disappointed.  The seat is very narrow at shoulder level and has no storage space at all except for a small drawer at foot level that is just out of reach unless you stand up.  My colleague had a middle seat which was much better - plenty of shoulder room and storage space.  But he had to step over the aisle passenger's feet when that seat was turned into a bed.  Really poor for a brand new plane.  And with so much space ion the plane I thought BA might go for a bar in Club, but no - you really could be in any other plane.  A real missed opportunity.

I have been flying business class for work for 30 years, so I have experienced many airlines service.  However,  It was my first time on a BA flight in over 10 years.  I was frankly shocked by the poor service.  If you are at all claustrophobic or appreciate having more than one drink served to you, you should avoid these window seats.   Looking backwards at your neighbor is bad enough.  Once the privacy screen goes up after take off, the flight attendants forget you completely.   Its just too much hassle for them to check in with you around the corner, I guess. 
I feel sad that BA has also followed the decline in service we see in all other US and EU airlines.  
If you have fly this route, I strongly recommend flying our of LAX or SFO with VA.   You will have stop over but the inflight experience will at least be pleasant."

I try to sit in row 30 any chance I get. As long as you don't need access to your carry-on (there's no under-seat storage) the added legroom of having a bulkhead seat is worth giving up that convenience. As others have mentioned, because of the media boxes, leg room is almost nonexistent in all the other seats. This row is also great because you don't have to climb over people or ask them to get up to go to the restroom. The downside to this - If you're in 30 D, E, or F, passengers sometimes use your legroom as a passthrough between the two aisles.

There is not a clear exit into aisles due to the seats in the aisles flat bed blocking your exit.  If you sit in the aisles you are interrupted by cabin crew who lean across you to deliver food and drinks to those sitting by the window or in the middle seats.  Beware of sitting in the middle for the cabin crew cannot see you and you are sometimes forgotten.  As there is 8 seats to every aisle it feels more like economy than business.

The side locker is fantastic, plenty of storage space. Will swallow a laptop, your shoes, lots of other stuff. These seats do have an equipment box right in the middle of your footspace, so you have to straddle either side of it, but its not as bad in practice as you think it will be when you first look down and see it. 
The only real problem with this seat is the reduced overhead storage space. The lockers are much smaller and soon fill up so get in early. And dont even think about trying to store any of these so called 'cabin approved' suitcases in there. Sit downstraits if you have anything bigger than a laptop rucksack."

Seats are super cramped and once the passenger in front of you reclines the seat you are squeezed in like a sardine! Its not worth even paying $39 to buy a seat. Just wait until 24 hrs out when there is no charge to pick a seat. British Airways should be ashamed for using this Dreamliner on long haul flights. On our next flight from London to Munich we flew the Airbus 320 which was heaven compared to the tortuerous 7.5 hrs flight on the Dreamliner.

On the way out the middle seat was empty so I and the passenger in 31C had plenty of room for our feet and cabin bits.  A pleasant surprise after reading others' reviews.

However, on the way back all 3 seats were occupied and even with all my stuff in the overhead, there was simply nowhere for me to put my feet because of the poorly located oversized IFE box where I wanted to put my feet.  I think that BA have sited these where they are easy to get at for maintenance etc, rather than out of the way (i.e. under the floor, or further forward under the seat in front) at the expense of passenger comfort.  I await the day when IFE is no more and passengers use their own devices for entertainment!"

Firstly underneath the seat in front are not one but two metal containers (entertainment system?)located by the seat legs. These severely restrict legroom and leave only a small space to place your feet.
Secondly there is a large gap between the seat and the window making it awkward to lean against the window. The gap also contains a storage cabinet with an open-able lid. At first this seemed a great idea, but the cabinets are off-set from the seat so that cabinet behind you encroaches into your space. Every time the person behind you opens their cabinet you get knocked by the lid - not great when you are trying to sleep."

The good - you are most likely to be the first off the plane, so if you are like me and want to be off as quick as possible then this one is great. Also as it's at the front of the section, you don't have to worry about anyone stepping over you from the middle seat.

The bad - I found the seat to be quite ""dark"" as the windows both sides are obscured by other seats, and after takeoff the flight crew pull the curtains that are right in front of you, so it's OK if you may want to sleep, but not so good if you want to work. You also have to put up with a constant stream of people who don't know how to use a curtain, which can be quite hilarious at times."

The overall time of flight was approximately 12 hours and I felt very  uncomfortable on my place among two other seats. My height is only 6 ft but I was unable even to turn a page of a book without heating with elbow against my neighbours. The light switchers located on the arms did not match the places exactly, it is enough to say that the switcher of light for the place at the window (K) was located at the place at the aisle (H). There were no personal cold air guns and I had to get accustomed Sao Paulo-like air conditions with my autumn coat designed for the London weather on. The multimedia entertainment was very poor by both its contents (too few new films, Hollywood production only) and technical quality.

The overall quality of flight make me to think that nothing has changed on the plane since it was produced some 25 years ago. It made a big contrast to a flight of Lufthansa with the same plane, where the arrangement of places was more suiting modern standards. By some miracle they wider seats and aisles, better conditions for comfort of each passenger. The other flights with BA ever taken by me were also of great quality.

The good thing I witnessed on the board of the plane was a great job of pilots, tasty meals and very kind stewards with great sense of humor.

Wish you all the best, many good take-offs and same number of peaceful landings."

You get an amazing view of the wing and is very good for take off and landing as you get to see the flaps and the spoilers in action! The only bad thing is I noticed that the seat I sat in, the In-flight Entertainment was set to the home page, not allowing me to watch any movies at all which was very upsetting. (It was the Gatwick 777-200, Old ones). Also my brother's seat, 22B, was in very bad condition. The tray table was broken and the head rest was falling apart. Watch out on some of these airplanes! Not all are like this but some are.

The seat is very comfortable and offers a great degree of privacy and a good overnight's sleep as the nearest seat is on the opposite side of the cabin.  This is also a very quiet cabin with only 14 seats and 2 dedicated stewards to provide the service.  On aircraft with the Old First cabin, there is a severe lack of power points available and the single point which was available required a special EmPower plug.  Also, the TV monitor was very small and not as good as in New First.  Overall I would say that, if you are travelling in Business then, unless the aircraft has a New First cabin, I would recommend a seat in Business in the upper deck.

The toilets are not bothersome as suggested by Seatguru, as they are for CW passengers only and the section is roped and curtained off to stop WT+ passengers using them. However, it does mean you have to go all the way back to row 35 in WT for the one toilet on that side and if that is in use, then all the way back to the plane for the other one toilet. There is no way to get across to the other aisle if the bassinets are in use! All in all, the toilet layout is poor for WT+ passengers who have paid extra. Food and entertainment was generally good.

In today's age of plane design, you should not have to hop over someone to get out of your row when in business class. The middle seats are something to avoid if you have issues with closed spaces.

While the 772 has two lavs up front, the 773 has none at all Instead, it has two adjacent to the galley area between First and Club World. The problem with this arrangement, therefore, is that everyone in Club World -- now expanded to 56 seats -- can use either these two lavs or the four at the back of *their* section ... which are also shared with World Traveller Plus. Worsening matters still, *all* of these lavs are curtained off during the majority of each flight for which they're used, which I assume is exclusively on long-haul routes. The curtains are meant to keep each cabin darkened and quieter, but getting *through* them when they're snapped into place is a bit of a chore, particularly if one happens to be half-asleep (as I was on my recent flight). 

On whole, however, I remain impressed with BA's new First product -- which btw is effectively identical on most, if not all, of BA's long-haul jets at this point -- with one exception: seat width. At 22 inches -- only two wider than Club World, although thankfully First is spared their dreadful eight-across seating layout -- they're *far* narrower than those found on the usual global-best suspects (with Singapore and Emirates leading the way, as per usual), and even worse, they've fallen behind even their intra-European competition. Air France's new First seat is 30 inches wide, and all of Lufthansa's 744s now have the *truly* remarkable combination of a separate seat AND bed (in what used to be space for two FC travelers) -- one with a bona fide mattress, no less.

Also, I know this is a problem on all 777s, but the front of First will always have the inexorable problem of housing a galley area and, of course, the cockpit. Regrettably, this substantially reduces the feeling of privacy one enjoys on a 747, where you're either in the compact upper deck or at the very front of the lower deck, with only the plane's nose in front of you. 

Please note that I'm complaining only because the competition among the dwindling number of international carriers that have retained separate first and business cabins is fierce, and I honestly can't say I'd ever *pay* to fly BA First on a 777 given that the cost is generally double that of Club World -- which may have eight-across seating but still has flat-bed seats only slightly smaller than First's. None of this is meant to infer in any way that flying BA First, regardless of aircraft, isn't light YEARS better than transatlantic travel in particular on any American carrier or, God forbid, coach. The (albeit narrow) seats are tremendously comfortable, and BA does an especially good job of selecting its best flight attendant to provide cabin service for all First sections. The amenity kits and pajamas provided are top-notch; men receive a kit filled with products from The Refinery, London's top men-only spa. The IFE system has touchscreen capabilities -- still unusual even considering we're years into the ""tablet computing era"" by now -- and a vast array of programming options. Finally, what First lacks in privacy and lavs is certainly balanced out by its top-notch cuisine and multiple wine varietals on offer ... though admittedly they're a notch below the Krug and vintage Dom found on the likes of Singapore."

seat was ok - much better room than economy  not alot of width but plenty of leg room.

Food was hmmm average but service super.

The seat reclines into a full bead. You can share your suite with your companion and have the FA set up a nice table to share a meal. The suite is quite roomy but sometimes I would have liked to have been able to look out the window and see the world go by. However, because of the way how your seat is at an angle you are a bit situated away from the window. The lavatory is a bit cramped and one is inclined to use the lavatory on the upper deck where you have more room to move about. The food was a bit disappointing, specially the tasting menu. Nothing really outstanding except for the Scottish langoustine. The high tea service was passable except the bread  was a bit tough. All in all, I think my experience with BA First Class service is exceptional specially the way how FA Caroline took care of my every need. Plus my experience in the Concorde Lounge at Heathrow was quite enjoyable.

The window seats have extra floor space you can keep your belongings next to you during the flight (excluding takeoff and landing) which means you can make the most of the room under your seat in front of you with you feet. These seats are not directly near the galley or toilets but give you easy access to the toilets without being too near, and access to the galley should you require anything from the crew during flight, also near the two rear exits. Only issue is that your some of the last to get off the plane, should you be in a rush you'd struggle to exit the plane quickly.

I had seat 10B which is first row of Premium Economy. While location is good and generally quiet, I noted the following. The foot rest is only of use to someone under 5'6"". Any taller and your knees buckle and very uncomfortable. The bulkhead means you cannot put your feat under seat in front to marginally less leg room. Unlike many Premium Economy cabins. bathrooms are all the way at the back of the plane. On other configurations, Premium Economy has dedicated bathrooms. This means walking through curtained area to back of plane and incurring wrath of Economy passengers who do not realize you have no bathroom. Also, difficult to time bathroom runs as close to 30 rows of people can pop out in front of you. Seat itself quite nice and good width but don't expect to be able to sleep if you are greater than 5'6"" as limited recline and useless leg rest mean getting comfortable not easy. 

I had no issues with arm rest monitor and passenger in 10A able to get past me with no disturbance. Nice not to have reclined seat in front of you.

Cabin overall quiet and less disturbance than Economy plus wider seats and a few inches more leg room. 

In summary, I still think the pick of the Premium Economy seats and excellent if you are a tad shorter tham me."

The compartments were too small to accommodate a standard size hand carry bag. Under the seat in front of our row was a box, so you didn't have any leg room or room for any other type of hand carry. It is a much more comfortable flight on the 777 economy or 747 economy than the Airbus 380 in economy. We have never been so stiff and sore after this 11 hour flight before.

There's lots of leg room, a great big space by the window, and no one behind to lean into.  Granted the seat doesn't lean back any farther than any other economy seat -- which is really not all that far, but the space around this seat is great.  It would be ideal if no one was in the other seat.  It would be good for a couple.  If I can't get into World Traveler Plus, I will always select this seat.
BTW, this aircraft does have really cool electronic window shade system that significantly reduces light coming in from the window -- such a direct sunlight -- yet still allow you to see out."

This seat is the best seat in the World Traveller cabin, as the armrest on the left side of the seat is moveable, which gives you unrestricted space on that side of the seat.  You have more space than the center seats on this cabin, which allows you to place your carry-on bag as a leg support to stretch your legs, if you wish so, to seat with your legs flat, which makes your journey VERY comfortable.  You also have unrestricted space and access to the aisle to move around your seat.  No passengers mingle around this area as it is located just behind Club World and there are no galleys or lavatories between both cabins.

More important to me is (1) easy access to the aisle, and (ii) a seat which has a bulkhead at the foot so people aren't climbing over you from the middle seats.

It's true that you can hear the toilets in front flushing but its not obtrusive if you have headphones on, espcially on this daytime flight. A very positive experience if you're lucky to not have any babies on flight. Worth noting though, had either bassinet had a baby in it, it would have been very difficult to get out and the BA attendants, while friendly, were openly apologisong about the pre-landing snack: a single miniature Mars bar or cookie!

The space is very claustrophobic with a tight squeeze to get into the seat. No space to put anything bar a small drawer just large enough for a pair of shoes to fit.
I hit my head on the ceiling several times. The height being about 1.5m due to the curvage of the fuselage.
I was cold on my right side due to the airconditioning flowing down the side of the plane, the screen was hard to see due to the reflection from the overhead lights.
This design makes it very hard for the crew. They have to reach over the passenger in 10B to serve me.
I also had problems having to climb over the passenger in 11B to go to the restroom.
I must say that the business cabin layout brings a whole new level to cattle class - the BA business cattle class."

Worst of all are the ""movable"" armrests in the World Traveller section, which can only be raised about halfway toward vertical.

These centre seats E&F are ideally suited for couples and you are together in your own pods! The crew do lower and raise the screens when serving drinks and food. The only trouble is that you have climb over the feet of the passengers to get in and out, in the row behind if they have the footrest down. It was also a bit strange to be facing backwards for take off and landing! Food is very good with a choice of courses and each course is served separately. Drinks are plentiful and you can make use of the galley if you require anything else mid flight. The only annoying factor was the entertainment system which we both paused when the meals were served and after that both our video and music tracks kept intermittently freezing. As it was a night flight wasnt too much of an issue but we would have been annoyed at this is we had paid the full CW price!

These are usually high demand seats so the low numbered rows are usually full. BA tend to start their service from the front of the econ cabin though, so good choice on food and drinks. A recent flight back from Accra in 29a was not nice, the screen failed shortly after take off, so I moved to the back of the plane and enjoyed 4 seats to myself in row 53! However, the cabin lights were perm on throughout a night flight which made sleeping, which is hard enough for me on planes, almost impossible. Luckily it's only 6hrs to LHR. Have booked 28B for my next outbound to Accra, I think it's better than 29A.

This is all for the same price.  The BA food is really what lets it down.  Meat is overcooked and like leather regardless of the animal.  Not good enough for the money.  This is the 3rd long haul First class seat I have had and its been similar each time.  Disappointing.

Business class seating is awful. Seats are side by side in opposing directions so that your privacy is seriously reduced. There is a translucent screen that goes up and down if you want to shut out your fellow passenger from view; however, the screen only works after take-off , and during meals it must be raised and lowered so that the attendant can reach across to deliver food trays and other materials. If you are seated in an aisle seat, the attendant is reaching across you to serve the window seat. The cubbies for storage are so small  that even my computer bag did not fit. The worst part of these seats is that if you are seated at the window, you must climb over the footrest of the passenger seated on the aisle of the next row. Each time I got up to use the restroom, I had to do an almost acrobatic move to get out. I'm pretty flexible and found it challenging, so I imagine it must be near impossible to get out if you have any mobility issues. Simply an awful, awful design."

While BA was pioneering flat bed seats in business, it is a bit falling behind now due to the fairly narrow seats. Yet, the seats facing the isle offer most space. 
Seats in the main deck also provided me very early exit from the plane in SF.

Food was very nice on the flight I had, I was positively surprised by quality and taste. Service was mindful and professional.

This relates to a non-stop flight we took in a BA 787 from London to Austin in late June 2014.




My wife and I were in seats 1J and 1K. You can see the seating configuration on seatguru.com I had the window seat, 1K. Within 15 seconds of getting on board, I could tell it was going to be unpleasant.




This ended up being the worst and most miserable international flying experience in my life. A flight we took in United Economy Plus from LA to Sydney a few years ago was far better.




I had been looking forward to flying on the 787 and enthusiastically bought the Club World seats for the non-stop from Heathrow to Austin. Big mistake. In my opinion, BA has absolutely screwed up with the seat design in the Club World section and made this a horrible passenger experience.




The seat unit or ""box"" is more like a coffin. No storage space to speak of in and around the seat. No ability to regulate the air. The air in 1K is very stuffy and stale because of the box. The cabin crew has difficulty serving 1K. They have to reach across 1J. Worse yet, once the occupant of 2J extends his or her seat, you won't be able to get to the overhead storage or to the lavatory. You are trapped in 1K. Getting to the overhead is a big deal when there is no storage room in the seat unit and all of your stuff is overhead. You better pass on the wine and cocktails, too, since you won't be getting to the lavatory.




The very few positive comments I've seen about seat 1K are misleading. Yes, it is private, but I would describe the privacy as the kind you get with a coffin. Total isolation, confining and no ability to get out of the box. 




The seat is no wider than an ordinary economy seat. It is not very comfortable in any position. It just has this goofy box built around it. You better like the person in 1J because you're looking straight at them when the privacy partition is down. The partition is down for a good portion of the flight, such as when the cabin crew is doing any type of service.




This is my first and last trip on BA between London and Austin. Even though I'm no fan of American Airlines, their first and business class seating in the 777 is far superior even if it means making a stop and doing a plane change at DFW. At least you have decent storage, ability to control the air volume and access to the aisle and overhead storage.




I wouldn't take a window Club World seat on a BA 787 again if it was offered to me free. I will suggest that the middle Club World ""E"" seat in each row could be just as bad as the ""A"" and ""K"" window seats if not worse.




BA received my comments in a post-flight e-mail survey and promised to follow-up with a call. I have never heard from them."

A small drawer ony big enough for a pair of shoes.  Krypton Factor challenge to get out of the seat to get to the loo - find somewhere to put headphones and whatever you have on the table (water/glass/anything) as the table needs to be closed, then put the foot rest up to be able to climb over the person in 12B so as not to wake them or you'll bash your legs on their footrest.
Privacy screen between A and B is good as regards privacy.  But cabin crew either can't see you or choose to ignore you and used glasses, etc. can stay on your table for ages.
My footrest didn't go down as far as it should.  Cabin crew member tried but shrugged and said it wasn't working properly - in case I didn't already know that.
View out of the window was of an engine filling the lower half of the window.  Sky above.

Interestingly, the design of the rear of the seat doesn't help as it magnifies all of the sounds - I tried sleeping the other way round, which was much quieter (but uncomfortable!) before retreating to 4K, which was fortunately empty.

Please know that seat 75k has 2 AVOD boxes in the foot area, reducing the amount of foot space available. The overhead storage bins are small and do not accommodate regular-size roller bags easily. The centre section overhead bins do accommodate bags like these easily, however, but you have to hope for a relatively empty flight to be able to spill into these bins. There is an extra storage bin between the seat and the outer wall of the plane which is big enough to hold a briefcase, or ladies handbag plus all the pillows and blankets provided by BA for your comfort.
The mood lighting was really nice and changed from white to blue to pink during the journey to compliment the time zone you were in.

By comparison with other F carriers there are a lot of seats upfront but overall, the 2010 upgrade is a masterpiece of understated design and quality. Service is invariably impeccable, food sometimes a bit patchy and slow. Almost always a good wine available and the trademark Laurent Perrier Grand Siecle will never cause distress. Familiarity breeds contentment.

Seats 1A and 1K as noted tend to he held back for Gold and above loyalty members or Pierce Brosnan. Although lovely, the seats are actually really quite close and really well suited in fact to couples. They are narrower at the foot end although do have the advantage of the large wardrobe in the nose. However those seeking seclusion are pragmatically referred to 2AK, 3AK and, especially 5AK (my favorites).

For couples 5EF far superior to 4EF for four reasons
1. They are wider at the foot end
2. They have greater seclusion
3. They have more 'walls' around the seat contributing to privacy
4. Those 'walls' enclose greater personal storage

This is a no brainer. 

So the obvious conclusion by exclusion is that you do not want to pay for any type of row 4 seat. Of course they are all preferable to 17E but if you are paying or using points instead of OpUps or do not have a family of four: this is a row to avoid. Least private. 4EF are particularly exposed to oncoming traffic from 123AK.

Still must say all seats better than anything in business by far except for 62AK and 64AK. See separate future report. And just impeccable service assured."

As much as I am a fan of SeatGuru there seems to be a default yellow rating for any seat near the toilets or galleys. 35K is such a seat but I disagree with the designation as, although it is next to the washroom, there is a wide gap between the back the seat and the wall of the toilet and it was never a problem on this flight. With only 30 seats the WT+ cabin feels exclusive and I would choose this seat again since the curve of the fuselage gives one a ton of space to the right of the seat, as well as ample under the seat in front. There is plenty of room here for a 5'10 person such as me. Well worth the premium (only $200 or so) over Econ in my opinion. The upgraded IFE is first class, crisp screen and ultra responsive. The food among the best I've ever had on a plane outside traveling up front.The 747 is still majestic and I would choose this flight across the pond, in this seat, anytime.

Instead, on the B777, it's possibly the worst seat in First (as opposed to the best on the 747).  This is not only close to the toilet, but also the FC Galley, as well as the CSD's ""office"", the crew jump seats and the boarding door.  The seat also has a shelf in front of it, which the crew use as a place to loudly plonk bottles of wine etc during flight."

BA has revamped their World Traveller Plus sections, and the effort shows.  The new seats are similar to those on Lufthansa, where the seatback is much thinner allowing for more legroom in each seat.  The recline was impressive, and the seat width was comfortable, even for a taller passenger.  This 777 config was a 2-4-2 layout, and I was in the window seat.  Plenty of room between the armrest and the wall to stash blankets and pillows.  There is a bulkhead behind the row, so no one behind to kick your seat.  Tray tables are in the armrests, so that may be a drawback for some.  There is a shared permanent drink tray in the armrest as well.

New entertainment systems were nice with a large touch screen with multiple movie and TV options, as well as other choices including flight status and maps.  There is a remote that is stored as an inset to the armrest, but the screen was responsive and I didn't need to use the remote.  

The only drawback I found was when the person in front of me reclined to sleep.  The pitch is pretty extreme at maximum recline and, paired with the immovable center armrest, made it challenging to exit the seat with the forward seat reclined.  

Cabin crew was very attentive and friendly, and the aircraft was clean.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend BA WTP for anyone wanting a little more space than a normal economy seat."

On my flight from LHR to SFO I was greeted with a generous pour(compared to WTP on A380) of sparkling wine in a stem glass before takeoff. The curried chicken meal was of restaurant quality and the little extras like ice cream and sweets/salty between services was nice. Due to the location of the galley and the much smaller cabin, service was much quicker and the nearby galley area was a few steps away for a stretch and place to stand vs the A380. Though the map shows my seat 35J in yellow, there was hardly any noise from the lavatory. The cabin crew were particularly friendly and attentive to my requests. The new seats and video were great.

After reading the reviews, i was a little concerned but was surprised that it wasn't that bad. It was a day trip back so it was OK that it didn't fully recline. It wasn't nearly as confining as the 747 flight going there. The only issue I had was that the air was cool and constantly blowing on that row without the ability to adjust.  Other than that not bad at all considering I'm 6'5""."

The entertainment box severely restricts legroom, which is already restricted because it is an aisle seat. Also, note that it appears that every economy D and F seat has a entertainment box getting in the way. The movable headrest doesn't stay in place (it appeared every seat suffered from this.) Probably the most uncomfortable flight I have ever taken.

I was very pleased with the seat, especially as our flight was delayed in DC for 3 hours due to bad weather.  I enjoyed the coziness of my seat by the window, with plenty of storage.  Fortunately, no one was in seat 58J which would have impeded my exit from my seat if they had been fully reclined.  As my  husband was in 57J, I enjoyed having the face to face seating, though I imagine it could've been awkward had I not known that passenger.  The amenities kit and quilt were good and the food was excellent.  Our cabin steward was very cordial and helpful.  The toilets on the upper deck of this aircraft in Club World are huge!  I was surprised at the almost non-existent noise level of this huge aircraft and I could hardly tell when we landed.  Excellent seat, excellent aircraft and I would definitely choose this again.

With these seats you are able to have a window seats (which is a nice little private area) without having to crawl over a sleeping passenger which is difficult . 

Upstairs is preferable to downstairs in any window seat because there is a side ledge so you have a nice spot to set personal items. 

In general I HATE the BA Business Class seating as I find it terrible as compared to cathay or American. It is awkward. The Aisle seating is very very narrow in B/C and you are always being nudged by FA's and passengers when they walk by."

This doesn't affect the TV screen and the tray table is slightly off about 2 inches to the left.

75E on the way out felt fairly cramped, and Im only 5 7. My partner, in the aisle seat 75D, is only 5 so she had no issues with knee room.

The return flight was a revalation. We were, luckily, allocated 77J&K on the upper deck. As previously noted, by others, the overhead storage bins on the outer seats are smaller than usual, so only two cases per binbut there are additional storage bins along sides seats A & K, and these are pretty capacious.
Also due to the arrangement of the bins, if you are a bit cheeky you could nab two as 77J&K span 2 bins and two windows.

I know others have said that the media box is an issue but I found that i could stretch my legs out full along the gap between the seat in front and the outer storage bins. This may not be possible on the lower deck equivalent seat.
You also getting the feeling  of more space as you can use the storage bins as an extra arm/leg/head rest, or table space.
This seat id just two rows in front of the toilet at the rear of the section but this was not a major issue, as the four toilets , accessible from this section spread the footfall pretty well.

I would definitely pay to pre-book this 77J&K.

In-flight entertainment system was pretty good, only minor annoyance was having to view measurements either in imperial or metric, not a mixture of both that we use in the UK.
The IFE screen tilts. This is particularly useful if the seat in front is reclined.
There is a headphone socket on the inside of the arm rest. This accepts standard 3.5mm plug so you can take your favourite headset with you. BA do supply a set but I suspect that they are pretty average.

I worked out how to remove the remote control/gamepad thingy, but could I get it back into its socket!?
The trick is to feed the cable back through the hole on the right-hand side of the holster. Once all of the cable is in, the handset should snap back into the holster.

The USB is a 'traditional' slow charger, so if you have one of those new fangled Quick-charge devices you'll just have to re-learn the art of patience( wonder if the sockets in Club World are faster).

Discovered the location of the  UK 3-pin power socket. It's in between each seat. This means someone has to share as there will be one fewer that the number of seats in the row.  

However, I have had it confirmed that the UK 3-pin socket will only maintain a laptop's charge not increase it, so if you've got a flat battery that it's plain hard luck. I'll test this out later. Best advice is to fully charge and don't use sleep mode, or carry a spare battery or three."

As a whole, therefore the cabin does not compare with say EK or SQ. If traveling with a companion this layout works, but it's not nearly as good with strangers.  On this flight the cabin was half empty, so some people were able to move to a seat which they preferred.  The storage space in this cabin is limited.

Other than having to pay 200$ to reserve it ahead of time (cash grab) it offers unfettered access to the aisle.
Unless the cabin crew is bashing around, its pretty quiet, and ask for an extra pillow for a superb sleep if you're an individual 6'4 or less and aren't wide as a house. In that case opt for the aisle.
Super private and amazingly quiet. British Airways have been tinkering with the menus of late and the offerings of steak (hard as a rock) or pheasant (pretty good) are accompanied by starters like Scottish Salmon (delicious) or Superfood Salad (chopped kale, anyone?)

There is very little privacy, the window/divider just makes it so that the crew has to hand food and drinks over the wall.  The seats are so narrow that if you have broad shoulders you won't be able to sleep.  Additionally there is no thought to technology in the seat design- there is a USB plug but no place to put your phone.  The video screens fold out for viewing and therefore you have to fold them back during taxi, takeoff, approach and landing.  I will likely never fly BA again because of this poor seat design.

In addition, there are storage compartments inside the ledge, which is really very handy, However, they don't line up exactly with the seats, so that the one behind me was reaching into my space, and mine creeped up into the space of the person in front of me, who decided to try to sleep by resting their head on the ledge, thereby blocking my storage door...

Overall, would not really recommend, unless you don't care at all about sleeping on flights."

The seat was comfortable. I sat in 77K outbound and 76K on the return flight. I selected these seats for no charge because I'm an elite class flyer. I chose the upper deck because of its 2-4-2 configuration instead of 3-4-3 on the lower deck. The cabin I was in was relatively small cabin with lavatories at both ends. The only time there was a wait for the lav was right after meal service. The small cabin also kept things quiet, and this is the quiestest, smoothest aircraft I've ever flown on. Please know that seats 76K and 77K have the AVOD boxes in the foot area, prohibiting use of the space to store my backpack. And know that the outer overhead storage bins are small and do not accommodate regular-size roller bags easily. The center section overhead bins do accommodate bags like these easily, however. One bonus for 76K and 77K is the  extra storage bin between the seat and the outer wall of the plane. It's not big enough to fit a backpack, but it could hold a briefcase, laptop bag, a lap top computer and/or any other loose items you have. The AVOD selection was immense and something I really enjoyed on the flight.

You cant reach your A/V controls without leaning into your neighbour's space.  Being so close to the toilets means your feet are frequently kicked by queueing passengers, but that is only when the toilets are functioning - which they weren't on my return flight.  Luckily on my return flight the plane was emptier and i moved to seat 30H which i would not exactly reommend but would certainly suggest as being a slightly more palatable form of torture.

If i ever have to take this flight again i will be stowing away under the wheels as at least it's free and i doubt any less comfortable.

The screen need to be flipped 90 degrees so that it faces you to watch movies. Unfortunately, the locking mechanism doesnt work so the screen cant be locked at 90 degrees and it doesnt face me. While serving drinks before take off, by the time the stewardess got to me, she had only wine, orange juice and water on her tray. I asked for apple juice and she replied that she only had those on the tray. No need to tell me that since my eyesight is good, so had to tell her to go and get the apple juice which she reluctantly do it. While serving breakfast, I told her what I wanted and even showed the item that I wanted from the menu. To my disgust, she said she cant see what I had pointed to, and even said she cant understand.
When the chief steward brought the buns, I chose 1 but changed my mind and took another 1. He raised his voice telling me to also take the 1st bun since he said its already been touched. If you dont want the passengers to touch the bun, why cant you put the bun on the passenger side plate using tong after the passenger has pointed to the bun that he wants? Other airlines are doing that, especially in business class.
Will try to avoid BA in the future."

I must mention Philippa in particlar.  Lovely woman and exceptionally competent at her job.  If given the choice, I would fly business class with BA again.  It is worth the extra money.

On the outbound, it was the daytime flight and PJs, pillows, blankets and bed made if you wanted.  On the return, only that dirty throw pillow they leave on every seat. Asked for a blanket and got a flimsy one they provide in economy. Service was 5-star and the crew were absolutely amazing, as was the food. Hard to figure out what the process for a la carte dining is. But the hard product was just a disappointment.  Plus, it was a remote gate, so we had to be bussed in after waiting on line in the stifling gate area, and then had to wait to board. Nothing exclusive or 1st class about that. You either pay $$$$$ or use lots of miles (as I did) to fly BA 2st when the AA 77W hard product is just as good for a lot less.

Negatives: the pull down foot rests are attached to the back of the next row's seat, so you can feel some movement if you have a fidgeting person behind you, and i was aware of the stewards footsteps walking up and down.

My TV screen was shifted by about 10cm to the left for that reason (as the row in front was normal) I had a measuring tape with me and seats in our row measured about 16 inches wide, an inch and a half narrower than all the other economy seats. In addition my husband's table was broken and sellotaped back, promptly falling off as soon as he opened it. The toilets stink was vile, pretty much the entire flight. Crew kept on spraying air freshener on top of it, which did not kill the smell. It was awful. BA told me that they are free to change the seat width as they please as long as the legroom stays the same. This puzzles me as 16 inches = 40 cm is below the width of an average male back and was about 4cm narrower than seats in other rows.

The A321 is very comfortable for short haul.

Never again ! We upgraded on the way out to economy traveller plus and it was heaven if you can get an upgrade i would do so otherwise i wouldnt bother if you want 9hrs of torture also person in front had their seat back full 9hrs of flight no need at all as this made the leg room even worse , next time i wont be going in economy will pay extra for upgrade !

It deserves to be marked red. This seat and 26C are not good because you get banged into the whole flight by people going to the toilet. In addition, the seat is quite opposite the curtains to premium so when people are passing by which is quite often, you keep having to move your feet because your in the way. It also blocks off the toilet keeping your feet in the way as the proximity is close. I would not recommend this seat at all. 26 B and J deserve a green mark because they are great seats. Of course despite overhead bins not being big.

Both were great flights. I loved the seat controls and the flat beds and 787 ambiance made sleep easy on these 14+ hour flights. Outgoing I'd rate a 10 due to the great pair of flight attendants. Return not as good due to indifferent crew. Didn'd use the entertainment system. Meals OK but their breakfast needs some work.  But overall F class in a British 789 is superb.

I always prefer to have no one behind me so the seats were great, for economy. You get normal recline and no one banging on your seat. The toilet door was set further back and didn't line up with the seats anyway. I didn't find the 2 entertainment boxes (that everyone goes on about on here) a problem at all, if anything I found resting my foot on top of one of them quite comfortable. Storage box in the window seat is so handy and being in the last row of the section no one else ends up leaning on it (they are all offset to the seats) found leg room fine, but seats are narrow and head rest is not great. Not as quiet as I expected on the top deck, sounded just like any other plane really. Entertainment system kept crashing for everyone, mine had to be reset by crew 7 times on 13 hour flight, also same with other people around me - it seemed to be linked to the interactive map.

As others have said the business class seating in this plane compared to American's 4 seats across is archaic and abusive. They have reduced the legroom so my 5""10"" wife could not lay flat and for me (6""4"") I was not even close. The seats are crowded, narrow and have little storage.

WRONG. BA should be ashamed of its World Traveller Plus Cabin on the Lon-NYC-Lon route. The cabins looks like the same ones I flew on nearly 20 years ago when they introduced this new class - but with all the wear and tear still there. Seats and footrests were damaged, ent screens were tiny, and for my seat there was reduced leg room due to ent box under seat - something that as a passenger you could at least be warned about before selecting a seat. Despite being a bit shabby, the seat itself was reasonably comfy given it is slightly wider than World Traveller but it doesn't seem to recline as much as the controls make out. One positive - service was super good BUT that's not enough. BA MUST LIFTS ITS GAME or people will desert this cabin class in droves. Don't waste your money or your points!

Though I don't often go Business, I found this seat to be a great choice - cossetted against the window and access to the aisle without having to climb over the les of a reclining fellow passenger in seat B as it has a little space that you don't have further forward in the cabin.  The seat was very comfy, the IFE great, service excellent and food and drinks very good.

Daytime flight, so most people were awake (previous flight was overnight - virtually silent cabin) - due to difficulty of access to window seat, the cabin crew uses the pass-through in this seat to reach the window seat - so many openings and closings of the partition, which means many awkward looks at/from that passenger. Upper level is the way to go - far less traffic and noise.

The flight attendants lean over you all the time to serve the inside seats facing backwards.  There is effectively no storage at your seat, including the pillow, blanket, and bedding...that you are told you can not have that on the floor or your lap.  So you have to stuff this in the overhead until you are airborne.   The seat does not fully recline...you have to manually unlock a panel at your feet and flip that down as your footrest and the lower part of your bed when you are ready to sleep.  I was lucky to have the first row and the aisle.  If you are behind that, your seat blocks the inside guests from getting out and they physically have to step over you to get out.  Not  a good design.  Food was good but service was average at best on the London to Singapore flight.  It is doubtful we would use British Air for Business Class again.  They do not measure up with other Airlines for comfort or service."

Additionally, since it is an aisle seat that is one seat space removed from the aisle, you are further away from bothersome foot traffic and can angle your legs into the space next to you to allow more room for stretching out. I'd definitely recommend it if you miss out on 25D or a bulkhead seat.

However, it got insanely cold by the exit during the flight, even with many layers on as well as the blanket. For that reason alone, I'll skip the extra $$ for the exit row and take 71A instead, with the window and storage bins.

There's an arm rest on the right that raises and lowers, but I couldn't get mine to raise.  The lowest volume level on the entertainment system was too loud.  Headphones are billed as noise cancelling, but they're not.  Beyond that, my wife and I both had the beef filet for lunch, and it was atrocious.  Have you seen those golf balls with the core made of what looks like tightly packed rubber bands?  Well that core is about the best description that I can give for that meat.  Finally, the crew was the most focused that I've seen in ages; focused on looking straight ahead so as not to accidentally see a passenger trying to get their attention.  Once, my wife was actually waiving her arms to catch the attention of one attendant, who walked right by her.  In their defense, the layout of the seats makes it impossible to serve the window or middle passengers smoothly."

The BA 788 seats in the economy is the most cramped I have ever flown in a long flight. The 788 is not suitable for 3-3-3 configuration. The A330 with 2-4-2 or B767 with 2-3-2 is much better. I am not sure what is all the hype regarding 787 being comfortable. In fact the BA 772 with 3-3-3 or their 767s are more comfortable than the 787. Air Canada A330 used to fly to London form Calgary and it was much more comfortable. 'Sadly' they have also switched to 787 now.

Both offer a much better experience in the business cabins.

The toilets are screened off by a two section curtain which is on an angle but staff will unless prompted (or you do it yourself) only close one of them. The second issue raised in prior reviews was the level of recline, I asked BA online services to conform the level of recline up front, the responses moved between evasive and not knowing, I can confirm that this row in the plane G-XLEB does have the standard level of recline as other seats so for at least that plane the level of recline is not an issue. The staff were really good on the flight, flying out to Hong Kong we flew the other flight which was in a 777-300, if you have the choice between an A380 and a 777-300 then go for the 777, all of the seats in premium economy are far better than this row. Given the choice between this or the A350/B777 options on this route, you'd definitely avoid this plane in this class.

Relaxing. 3) TV screen and choice of entertainment was just fine. 4) Larger windows a plus. 5) Much quieter than any other plane (have been a regular trans-Atlantic flyer for 31 years). 6) Pleasing, subtle interior lighting. Gentle  ""wake-up"" sequence. 7) Those curved wings! 8) Even the lighting in the bathrooms was pretty.  No-touch fawcetts/taps appreciated.

The unbelievable lack of privacy of having someone facing you about 18 inches from your face is appalling.   The seats have no storage space, even for head phones.  Complicated buttons for opening tv and trays.   
More important that the bizaar seat design was the complete lack of service in this part of the plane.   All the service comes from a galley two section forward.   The flight attendants never bother to come this far back in the section.   For the 10 hour flight, I was offered one cocktail, one glass of wine, and one glass of water.   Period.   When I wanted another glass of wine with my meal, I had to go to galley and pour it myself, while the flight attendant stood chatting and amused.

Despite their poor seating arrangement for business class, they do not allow you to reserve your seat choice at the time of your booking.  Rather, if you wish to reserve your seat (for you and/or your spouse) they require to pay extra, based on the location and orientation of the seats. We did this for both the outbound and return flight, but our reservation (that we paid for over two months in advance) was lost for the return flight and BA tried to give me the rear-facing middle seat.  After acknowledging I had reserved the seat, and seeing the paid receipt, they found a similar forward facing aisle seat for me.  My wife has her return flight a week later and when I returned from my flight, I checked manage my reservations on the British Airways webpage.  Sure enough, her seat reservation is now not showing.  When I try to make the changes to reserve her seat, it will allow me to make the shorter connection flight but not the longer flight from Hong Kong to Londonthe flight we paid the premium for.  It indicated I must call customer service, who proved to be no help.  They informed me they would have to speak to my wife (still traveling in China) to make a seat selectioneven though they begrudgingly admit I made the reservations and paid for the seat premium.  I lodged a complaint but have received no feedback from BA, nor has the seat reservation been resolved.  Bad service BA, and lack of customer support.

The seat is comfortable but not that wide and the design means that although you have two complete windows they are too far away to see much when you are belted up, and when you are flying it is just water.

Being in a row of 3 the seat is a little boxed in but this gives some extra privacy. The gap for the seat is slightly wider than the seat itself and this allows for a narrow shelf to the right of the seat which is great for storing the blanket and pillow when not in use. As with most BA Club seats you do need to clamber over someone's feet to get out but in this seat you have a choice of two directions to go. Being in the front upper cabin means you have the two front toilets available which are much larger than normal. The stairs are also easily available to offer some exercise in flight if wanted. Overall would recommend this seat in Club.

First, I'm 6'5"", so the 72"" pitch was pretty worthless, and the surprisingly narrow (for business class) seats made finding a comfortable position for sleep pretty much impossible.   Second, once the passengers in 2D and 2F put their feet up, you are forced to climb over them if you want to get out to use the WC or grab a snack.   IMO all of the center seats should be marked ""caution"" for these reason.   

There is no overhead storage for 1D-E-F (you have to stow over 1B) and very little space to stow things in your ""cube"".   There is no air control; the headrest does not raise or reposition.   

I'm at a loss to understand how BA could order a new plane with so many design compromises.   Our flight back will be in premium economy and I'm already dreading having to troop all the way to the back of the plane to use the toilet - but there's no way I'd pay to upgrade to Club World in this configuration again."

I looked at all the seats in Plus (the flight was quiet) and they are all the same in terms of legroom and space, the window seats have good storage bins between the seat and window, the seats are a great improvement on the 747 and 777, more comfortable and more recline. The entertainment system is on a different planet altogether from the 747/777 it's excellent, dozens of the latest films and programs on a screen that's twice the size of the old 747/777 . people are correct when they say the overhead bins by the window seats are small and won't take a cabin bag but the ones in the centre do and there's usually plenty of space.

It was also the most miserable 6 hours of my life. I'm only 5'3, snd my knees were almost pressing the back of the seat in front of me. Crossing legs is out of the question.  There were a few times I needed to reach my medication under my seat and had to dig through my bag blindly because there was no way of getting my small bag up from between my legs or on the sides. The BA starff was very friendly and the food could have been worse. I'm still in the UK and I'm already dreading the flight back to America.

These seats have toilets directly on either side; these are within touching distance of seats D and F.

Overnight Mumbai London. Yes there is leg room but be prepared to be trodden on by people who seem to need the toilet several times during the flight. A constant procession all night of unsavoury men queueing for the toilet, opening door and then flushing chain- noise was horrendous! The area in front of seats also has more lighting presumably so people can find the toilets. They actually stand right in front of you while they are waiting. Who wants to eat a meal with the vision and constant noise from a public toilet? Avoid at all costs.

BA,s website clearly shows a 2 seat configuration when booking, when in fact it is 3, with No extra Legroom or width in the seat. You pay a premium for a Club seat when what you get is a Standard Euro seat. At best it is misleading and very disappointing that BA chooses not to show the correct seating arrangements I would have expected better from them. Of course you only find this out once you have boarded and are committed to a uncomfortable three+ hour flight. Don't bother with Club class you will waste your money.

The most striking feature is quietness and that the IFE is much better than 747-400.

However the rules of seat selection are not the same as the old 747-400! First of all the upper deck window in J is no longer my default as it was on the 747-400. The reason is that the bins (although good) are not as big. The second is that the curvature of the aircraft given the 2-3-2 layout means that there is a slightly claustrophobic feeling that is not encountered on main deck window seats. Best picks overall are 53K and 53A as they offer direct aisle access but another good (if risky) pick on flights that are not full is the middle E seat which is wider, and 53E offers direct aisle access. But not as good if the flight is full as you are trapped needing to maintain two privacy screens and not all FA approach the seat from the aisle using, instead, the intrusive button feature. 

On the main deck 15A and 15K are good picks because they are recessed and relatively private, there is direct aisle access, and also because 15B and 15J are often unoccupied. 15B and J themselves are highly undesirable for two reasons. First they are directly next to toilets. Second reason is that incomplete enforcement of cabin separation means a procession of Y class passengers come to use these toilets and loiter around waiting sightseeing at the back of J cabin which can be distracting. One other thing: the main cabin windows and the upper deck rear cabin (56 through 59) do not really offer a view of anything other than a vast wing! 

In the F cabin the suites are noticeably bigger than 747-400. 1A and 1K are very private but (as someone commented) useless for people travelling together. Neither are the centre seats particularly good for couples as they are angled widely away from each other so in practice one might as well choose 2 windows and use the companion dining feature."

Being near the toilet didn't bother me, but I suppose it could be more of an issue on a longer flight (this was just BOS-LHR).  One thing to be aware about is that there isn't any overhead storage directly above this seat so you may struggle to store your bag if you're late getting onboard and the lockers aren't too big on the upstairs cabin anyway.

Overall though, a pleasant flight and I think the person on the inside could easily step over your legs without waking you if you were trying to sleep."

I thought they were good choices for this aircraft, especially this window seat, since you don't have to cross over anyone's legs to get out.  There WAS a feeling of lack of privacy in the aisle seat, but I didn't experience any discomfort from proximity to the restrooms or galley.  I thought seats facing each other would be strange, but it was fine for us.  Service was great on this particular flight.  Not as good on the return flight.  There's a small drawer to store your things during take-off & landing.  Larger stuff has to go in the overhead bins.

Plenty of leg room for a 5' 9"" person. I was comfortable the entire flight (10 1/2 hours). Loved the extra storage bin next to the window. Was able to store items that I'd normally put under the seat in front of me. But having that storage gave me room to move my feet around. Entertainment was good. Touch screen is a little sluggish but you can use the handheld remote for better response. The only minor issued I had was that the seat in front of me tilted back so far that it made it hard to get out of the seat to use the head. Other than the mild body contortions to get out of the seat, it was a very good flight."

Also not allowed to check in luggage until 21.45:check in was that slow we didn't eventually get to departures until 45 mins before flight so sorry Malaga airport, couldn't spend any money with you no time.......

I was horrified with how little legroom I had in this seat as well as how narrow it was. I got off with a sore back and leg as a result. It was only when I googled a couple of days later, I realised that BA had added in an extra passenger per row changing the layout from 3-3-3 to 3-4-3.
