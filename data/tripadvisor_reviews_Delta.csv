February 2020|Delta is better than United. I am a long-time United Frequent Flyer, but Delta is definitely better than United. In Comfort+ (Delta's name for Premier Economy) alcoholic beverages are free, they come by with snacks at least twice on a 3 hour flight, the seats are very comfortable, and the entertainment system has a large number of choices.|40|Delta
February 2020|"Upgrades in economy to Bermuda not worth the money. I have had issues with Delta in the past, but this flight was fine -- short and uneventful. On the way back our flight window was moved up and we arrived 20 minutes early. It's only a little more than 90 minutes in the air -- time for one pass of the drinks cart. So if you are paying for the main cabin plus with extra leg room and free drinks, it's not really necessary for this short hop -- and you will get only one ""free"" drink for your effort."|40|Delta
