I sat with my cousin on Row 35. Barely any legroom, tables were loose and the pockets on the seats in front were broken. Very cramped plane.

Half the flight spent the flight either standing or clutching their backs upon landing. Delta should be ashamed of having this plane in its fleet."

On the plus side to this proximity too the galley, the forward part of the cabin is served first and service seems more attentive than seats further back in the cabin making meal service quick, which is great for shorter east coast to Europe transatlantic flights where sleep time can be limited.

I have flown in this configuration several times and think it is the best long-haul domestic offering of the major airlines.

* Flight got off to a terrible start due to a 3-hour mechanical delay at CDG. Supposedly a sheet of ice had formed over a cargo door during its transatlantic flight that morning, rendering it impossible to open for quite some time.
* Delta proceeded with boarding about an hour late, after which everyone sat there twiddling their thumbs in frustration for another two hours before the plane moved.
* Delta's halting, indifferent attempts to communicate the situation to its passengers deserve a letter grade of ""F.""  Over and over and over, we were informed that departure would take place in ""just a few more minutes."" Lies, all lies, I tell you.
* Aircraft is NOT equipped with WiFi, despite cards in every seatback pocket touting Delta's Gogo service.  When I asked a flight attendant how in 2015 a long-haul airplane could not have WiFi, particularly when said service was prominently advertised, she replied ""It's frustrating, isn't it?""  Uh, yes it is, particularly when I hoped to log on to Delta.com to check on re-booking my connecting flight that you caused me to miss.
* Overhead bin was too small to accommodate my bag straight-in; had to load it lengthwise.
* I did very much like the 1-2-1 seat layout in the Business Elite section.  I was on the far right side of the plane with no one next to me.
* Amenities kit was fine, with everything you'd expect and then some (even eyeglasses cloth).
* In-flight entertainment system offered a pretty decent selection of movies, TV, and music.  
* Food was good in terms of both quality and sheer quantity.  Champagne and wine both offered at various points.
* Flight attendants were friendly, polite, and professional.  Some bordering on grandmotherly, though, ahem.  Also, only some of the flight attendants seemed genuinely bilingual, which at times made things difficult for some of the French passengers.
* Delta, please reconsider your pre-flight video message featuring cornball humor and your CEO.  I'm sure I was not alone among 200 disgruntled passengers when I flipped the bird in the direction of Richard Anderson's copraphagic grin.
Overall: the flight & cabin crews did what little they could to make up for the disastrous start of our flight, but when an airline takes 3 hours to deal with a balky cargo door, thereby dooming 200 passengers to missed connecting flights, and further maroons them with no WiFi for 10 hrs, it's hard to say one had a pleasant experience.  The lesson, as always: Delta sucks."

Why LH chose the two-seat side-by-side arrangement in business class is beyond me. They should have joined their Star Alliance partners and gone for single seats when they upgraded business class a few years ago. In the middle rows on the A330, A340 and A380 as well as on the upper deck on the B747-8 they've even chosen to angle the foot end of the two-seater in towards each other so both share a rather narrow space with a flimsy divider in between. This is due to space restrictions. That said, the seats themselves are very comfortable and the service impeccable. The problem is of course that your co-traveller in the window seat has to climb over your legs when you're sleeping which can easily disturb you. In the outermost (window) rows of these aircrafts the seats are aligned parallell to each other. Another peculiarity in the LH seat is that apart from the seat control itself, all other functions such as light, attendant call etc. are hidden under the foldable armrest. That means you have to get rid of whatever glasses, books etc. you've placed next to you in order to open the lid and press the buttons. Strange. On the plus side, the seat is, as mentioned, very confortable. I'm 195/6'5 and slept very well indeed. As for the B747-8 itself, it's a bit more noisy than expected, especially as speed picks up you notice an increase in the airflow induced noise. This might be better downstairs, I don't know. Perhaps the grand old lady is starting to show her 1960's basic design, but compared to the  A380 and even quieter A340-600 it's a marked difference for the worse. Given a choise I would take the A340-600 any day."

Also lack of space to store anything in the seat area (phone, glasses and drink) mean you're having to do a juggling act.

If you are at a window seat, you sometimes get forgotten because the flight attendant can't really see you or an empty glass!

However, it should be noted that this style of exit seat is the removable panel type, rather than swinging door type, so its slightly less expansive than if you had a full on bulkhead style exit row. 

While the extra legroom is great, the biggest drawback is the lack of padding on this seat. While I am usually not one to agree with the amount of discomfort some passengers report on exit row seats, I have to agree in this instance. I sat in this seat for all of five minutes while on the tarmac before I noticed just how uncomfortable the seat it - you can feel your bones essentially hitting the metal on the other side of the padding. 

I moved to the middle Comfort+ row 19 before takeoff (it was a very empty flight - was able to lie down across three seats). The padding on these was significantly more comfortable, and the legroom differential wasn't enough to deter a 6'3'' person like me."

In the 763s, DL was considerate enough of their customers to provide additional leg room for their Comfort bulkhead seats, but on 764s, the endless chase for revenue took over in the form of squeezing as many rows as possible. Greed is good!

Only the ""first Class"" on this plane has the new Business class seats (used on their 777) with  aisle access on every seat. Food was alright but the wine list was a basic sparkling (not actual champagne), red or white. And the only red wine they had available ran out before the main course! There is also no amenity kit offered either. In other words, if you need a real business class experience, you will have to book a First Class seat on this plane. Overall this product that is heralded by AA as a breakthrough is pretyy underwhelming and the fact it's a one-aisle plane does not help either."

No more angle lie flats, having the middle person hop over you, etc., etc. Bottom line, you get a pod like setup with plenty of privacy. I will be taking my 5th flight in this business class configuration and am soooo excited as I can finally get some sleep. 
Pros - LOTS of personal space/desk space. Enough Privacy to get some sleep. Nice NEWER plane layout with seats that fully lie flat.
Negative - Getting up and down requires a little twisting if you leave your seat flat. Also, with the way the seat extends/lies down into the pod, you can pick up some 'smells' from the person behind you. Unfortunately my last flight the person behind me had an upset tummy and made my sleeping experience less than desirable as it was easily smelled. 

Overall, GREAT configuration, and MUCH better than the recent BA World Traveller I sat in and paid more $$ for."

Overall experience is good, I'd have no problem going with this seat next time."

I paid extra for it (about $150 US dollars more).
The pros:
The legroom is great.
We were able to bring out bags down from the overhead (after takeoff) and setup a little campsite in the space.
Its nice to be able to standup and stretch and walk around whenever you feel like it.
Despite what others said, we didnt notice the cold at all.

The cons:
Its true what they say, the galley is LOUD. It doubles as a staff room  so I frequently had off-duty crew standing at my feet chatting to the staff inside. This got annoying after a while and I had to ask them to move inside so I could try and sleep
But you cant sleep. From the noise, to the people constantly bumping you. This will drive you mad by the 9th hour (why people? WHY? Can you not see me??!!). Hint: I finally figured out if you raise your TV it acts as a barrier  so your blind and clumsy co-passengers will hit that instead of you and you can keep sleeping. My wife in 80B didn't have this problem and her sleep was better than mine. 
Your overhead light is always on because of the galley. So when the rest of the plane is bathed in soothing darkness for sleep, you get the glaring lamp above you 24/7.
The narrow seat is a little uncomfortable. Im an average size guy but I got a case of bum-cramp by the end of the 14 hours because I couldnt shift my position enough.

VERDICT: The cons even out the pros in my opinion, so dont pay more for this seat. The worst part for me was that  flight was only 1/3 full, so I got to look at every other aisle with passengers spread out on 3 seats, sleeping in the quiet dark while I returned to by fluro-lit position next to the gossiping staffroom. Its only worth the money if you know the flight is going to be full or if you're not planning to sleep, otherwise Id take my chances in another seat."

The bad - I found the seat to be quite ""dark"" as the windows both sides are obscured by other seats, and after takeoff the flight crew pull the curtains that are right in front of you, so it's OK if you may want to sleep, but not so good if you want to work.

After 4 hrs in the seat, my butt ached from the lack of padding, my neck ached from using the neck pillow for my shoulder.  The legroom was nice, but not worth it."

First, because of the curvature of the plane, there is about 8-10 inches between the seat and the window. However, rather than have empty space, Lufthansa has installed small ""drawers"" of sorts to store one's stuff.  As a consequence, one does not need to put anything under the seat in front because there is both overhead bin space as well as these little drawers between you and the window. Second, because there is only business class on the upper deck, you can exit the plane far faster. For example, I was off the plane before they had even connected the jetbridge to the lower deck.

But even though they make it impossible to stretch out both legs at once without contorting your body, the seat remains  more comfortable than other AA flights by a wide margin. 8/10"

Not at all what you want or are expecting when connecting from a trans-Atlantic LH BusinessClass wide-body flight.  Was no different at all from cattle-class Economy seating in US.  MAD-FRA was a little better because there were open seats on the aisle, allowing for a bit more room to stretch across with your legs.  The blocked-off middle seat, though, makes it impossible to stretch out your torso at all.  FRA-MAD was full in BusinessClass and therefore miserable. Service was good, especially with our MAD-FRA F/A but that doesn't make up for extreme sitting discomfort, especially in supposed BusinessClass.  Just to get something in a carry-on from under the seat in front of you is going to require serious contortionist training (and probably a chiropractor visit afterwards).

Some positives are that 46A seems to have more legroom than most economy seats, the aisle here is wide which means you can stand in the aisle when sorting out bags without blocking it and because the row in front is 3 seats wide, you get extra under seat storage.

The IFE is also tremendously small, about the size of an phone screen but two yards from your face and to make matters worse, the screens are so outdated they are tremendously dark even with the brightest setting. 
Seats 15A and G do have windows but they're a little ahead of the seat so you're going to have to crane your neck. That part wasn't really an issue. 
For econ comfort I would recommend any other row outside row 15; however, in my opinion, best row is 30 seats AB/FG.

Specific to this seat, 1). I think the business class seats half-way back are the best because they're far enough away from the galleys/lavs and receive less light as a result.  2) The center seats are in some ways less private but really, they way they're configured, you cannot see the person next to you unless you lean way forward.  In general: This business class configuration is ideal and I really can't see the benefit of First Class over this.  I like that the 777s give you an additional air control if you want it, I like a lille air circulation when I sleep.  The service is perfect and I love this herring bone model where one never has to bother another passenger to get up. There is a decent feeling of privacy.  As others have said you may be more comfortable sleeping if you flatten the seat all the way, then raise it ever so lightly to get the bump out of it.

The plane (LGW to Antigua) was very old. The plastic wall cover parted, there was a gap, the window was so scratched from the outside that looking out wasnt enjoyable, the seats were dirty and smelled of years of not being cleaned. All the trays and the armrests were dirty, I used 3 wet wipes before it was cleaned. Again, the FA didnt do much about it, said sorry and that was it. (I have photos to show the state of the seats).

Because the trays had crayon markings all over it is obvious that BA deliberately assigns these seats to families with small children. 

The proximity of the lavatories were actually fine, the seats reclined, but because they are narrower than the other seats I would advise anyone against accepting/booking these seats.

The issue is that instead of allowing a tray to slide forward on an arm, the tray is pinned into a fixed distance between the passenger and the tray; and it is too close.

I had this seat for the 11 hour flight from Los Angeles to NRT. The bulkhead row 12 seats have way more legroom than the main cabin extra seats in rows 13 and 14.

Sure you may not be able to store anything at your feet for takeoff and landing but what difference does that make when you can get up with ease as many times as you want.

Cushion width on my seat was 18"", which when combined with the fixed sides (armrest design) meant that I had to sit with my legs together for the whole flight.  Seat pitch is correct (38"") but huge IFE box is mounted under the seat in front (its about the size of a large shoe box) so only one leg has any legroom.  If you are of tiny stature (and very slim!) you will be able to twist your body to angle your legs to avoid the IFE box.  But then I guess you probably wouldnt need a PE seat in the first place :-)
Im 6'2"" and of average build (before you ask!).  I fly many times per year, but this was my first PE seat on a BA 747.  I have flown with many other airlines and have a good knowledge of economy and Premium economy seating.  For what its worth the BA747 PE seating is easily the worst seat I have ever paid for.  
BA also charge handsomely to sit with a fellow traveller (no free allocation in PE with BA), plus theres no lounge access etc etc.
All things considered, this was a really poor experience except for the cabin crew who were excellent.
To add insult to injury, my seat was also damaged and (in my opinion) unfit for service/purpose.  Have complained to BA via their survey but dont expect a response from them;  I had already written two complaints to them previously (prior to travel, regarding other issues) and didnt get a satisfactory response on those occasions either!

Despite how I might come across in my wording, Im a pretty laid back traveller thats easily pleased.  I think BA have many issues with their management's thinking, attitudes and policies.

This is purely a money-earning exercise by BA who just want the max £££'s from their business class customers, and blow their comfort

- the 2-4-2 firstly means the seats are very narrow, the legs part of the seats/bad area is narrower than the seat section to accommodate the shoulders/seat of the adjacent passenger.

- the narrow part means you can't sleep on your side, if that's what you do, as there's nowhere to bend your legs

- the aisle eats are very open and exposed to the aisle. In mid-flight with everyone sleepign it is an obstacle course to reach the loo as people's bedding is falling off, knees, elbows and feet are sticking out and I more than once woke someone by accident (not noticing feet with dark socks on for example). If you're in one of those seats, there is a draught every time a crew member passes - usually at a lick as they are understaffed and tryign to get round everyone asap.

- the in-seat faciliites are awful. There is one pathetic light, tucked under the lip of the partition and impossible to find except by asking a crew member. There is nowhere to put anything. There is a small drawer - at floor level, down by your feet. Also by that drawer as a mains socket and a USB socket. By your feet I reiterate. The drawer and sockets cannot be reached if the ""bed"" is reclined in sleeping position, or even if you just have the legs-up position, watchign a film or using the tray, etc

- the meal tray is pathetic - flimsy as all get-out, and not easy to fetch out from its hidey-hole

- the ""bed"" is short. Now, I am 6'6"" and always have a small bit of trouble on any flight or sleeper train journey, but most beds are 78"" or thereabouts. The BA 777 ones have to be somewhere between 72"" and 75"" at the most. I could nowhere near lie straight, nor due to the narrowness (as above) sleep on my side with my legs bent. Whilst I am above average height, there were plenty of other passengers somewhat crammed in to their beds, and I would imagine if you're more than say 6'1"" you are going to not be able to lie out flat, except for just 4 seats (16A,E,F,K)

- the ""flat bed"" is not. The backrest goes nowhere near flat.

- the 2-4-2 layour means to get to the central passengers the stewards have to lean right over the aisle passenger and access via a small space provided in the partition. Bad for the staff and bad for the aisle passenger.

- the central two passengers (centre 2 of the -4-) are shoulder to shoulder with no privacy whatsoever and a thoroughly inadequate divider screen. Sleeping (/trying to sleep) right next to a stranger like that is, as my wife said, like being back at Brownie's Camp, in a tent. If on the other hand it's the adjacent aisle passsenger you don't know, you spend the flight looking straight at them from not very far away at all, unless you put the screen up, whereupon the stewards can't get to you to hand you your meal.

- the piece de resistance is the obstacle course for inner 2 centre or window passengers to get out. If the aisle passenger is sleeping you actually have to CLIMB OVER them to get out, say to the loo. Physicaly possible (though still not acceptable!) if you've legs as long as mine, but if you're shorter, or have a gammy hip like my wife does, this is too hard and you're going to have to ""hold on"", or risk disturbing the aisle passenger

I absolutely don't know whatever possessed BA to accept this layout. They should have simply done a 1-2-1 angled layout like they have in 1st class, or like decent airlines use. Suffice to say that we will never ever consider a BA Club World flight. Our insurers also paid as much for this flight as we did for our return flights on Cathay, albeit they were booked well in advance; the point being though that BA don't reduce their Business Class price in compensation for such a terrible layout"

 The Bose headset looked as though it should plug in to the three-pin socket on the outside of the cabinet containing slippers and toliet bag.  After plugging it in the headset did not work, and then I discovered with the help of the attendant that it actually plugs in to the socket inside the cabinet which you locate by looking into the mirror on the cabinet door! Why AA came up with this design is a mystery to me.
 The cabinet door refused to close due to difficulties with the closing device. Jamming a folded-up piece of paper in between door and cabinet worked, but this is a small problem that should have been fixed since I was advised it was not uncommon.

They had run out of eye masks, not helpful when in such a seat as when other travellers go to the loo through the curtains the light hits the seat directly.  Incredibly warm flight as well. Sorry BA - this seats sucks!"

I think BA have messed up big time with this economy layout on the 787. The interior feels cramped and cheap. Seats are nowhere near wide enough, especially for Trans-Atlantic. The entertainment system box under the seat in front just makes legroom even worse. The tray table is also flimsy, and would not adequately hold my laptop without it repeatedly sliding around. Also 31C is two rows back from the washrooms, which on this aircraft seem to repeatedly slam loudly when people exit the washroom - irritating and not a problem I have noticed before on other aircraft. 

The only positives are the variable tint windows, which are a nice feature and are nice and big. It is also a noticeably quieter cabin compared to other BA aircraft (maybe this is why the door slamming seemed worse). There is also a USB charging outlet in the seat in front of you (although I didn't try this).

Unfortunately, I will go out my way now to avoid this aircraft. Fortunately Toronto and Washington are not frequent routes for me. I would much rather be on a BA 777, or even an older 747-400. These are a far more pleasant experience in economy. A big shame - one would hope that newer aircraft would give a better passenger experience. Not in this case I'm afraid."

For me (1m80 6'0"") there was plenty of space for both legs. Also, on the upper deck there's an extra space of more than 30cm (1 foot) between the outer seats and the plane's hull where you can easily put your right leg.
There's also a storage compartment next to you between the seat and the hull/window which was large enough for me to store the blanket+cushion+headphones (provided by Lufthansa to all passengers), my neckcushion, laptop, a bag and some other stuff.
In-flight entertainment system has many options like movies, music, fight data, live tv and also live camera feeds from the front/tail/under the airplane. Really cool feature imo. The system is somewhat slow to react to user input unfortunately. Seems like the cpu is a bit undersized for the job.

"1612887447-18390","https://www.seatguru.com/airlines/American_Airlines/information.php","Boeing 787-9 (789)","https://www.seatguru.com/airlines/American_Airlines/American_Airlines_Boeing_787-9.php","I had the opportunity to fly on AA 963 on November 14 from DFW to GRU (Guarulhos - Sao Paulo, Brazil), the equipment was a Boeing 787-900 with AA's new International Premium Economy class. The aircraft went into service on this route on November 3, so it had been operating less than two weeks on this route.

Upon boarding, a shrink-wrapped plastic bundle was waiting on each Premium Economy seat; it contained a fleecy blanket, pillow with patterned paper pillowcase, over-the-ear headphones, and an amenity kit consisting of a felt envelope containing an eye mask, ear plugs, disposable socks, and compact toothbrush/toothpaste. If you unwrap all of it, there isn't really anyplace  to put it other than shoved next to you in the seat or under you in the seat.

Mine was the first flight for many of AA's flight attendants on this plane. They were unfamiliar with the class of service and AA's intentions for the cabin. They were also unfamiliar with how to deploy bulkhead-row infotainment screens and how the seats controls are meant to work.

Probably because of the flight attendants' unfamiliarity with the plane, cadence of service was off.  The flight attendants were hand- carrying a lot of items from the rear galley to the forward galley which is immediately ahead of the Premium Economy cabin (between Premium Economy and Business Class). I overheard discussion that some food/beverage wasn't catered to the correct galley. 

After what seemed like an eternity, we got snack/drink service, though the snack was delivered and drink order taken, but it took about 10 min for my gin and tonic to arrive (and it arrived without the gin). Immediately thereafter dinner arrived- no time to enjoy my cocktail before dinner. When dinner was served, it came with a wine glass on the tray, but no offer of wine was made (and indeed, the wine I did finally get was poured into a plastic cup instead of being poured into the wine glass on my tray).  The dinner was all on porcelain dinnerware, except for the hot entree which was served in a plastic disposable tray. The meal itself was OK- at least the food on the real plates. There was a prawn cocktail, green salad, and lemon cake for dessert. The main had the typical ""Chicken or Pasta?"" options; the chicken in the disposable I chose tray was typical back-of-the-plane fare. 

Cadence of service was off at breakfast service (60 min before arrival) too- the food preceded the drinks cart by 15 min. Breakfast consisted of fresh fruit, a warm cinnamon bun, and some yogurt. I'll give a dishonorable mention to the coffee served with breakfast- it was truly terrible, to the point of being undrinkable brown fluid. It tasted like the inside of the plastic pitcher from which it had been poured. 


Some comments on the cabin itself - it's just 3 rows of 2-3-2 configuration (rows 9-11); each seat has its own video screen (larger than economy), its own armrests (one of which contains a tray table, the other has storage and a mains outlet for charging devices). At the bulkhead, the leg/footrests were great and legroom was good, though the leg rest is too short to support my long legs properly. The seat width was appreciated, and very noticeable when walking back through the economy cabin to use the lavatory. The seat's headrest is adjustable, and it has flaps on each side to support the head for napping, though the 15% max seat recline isn't enough to really get comfortable.


There is a lav-occupied indicator on the bulkhead at front of cabin, for the two lavatories immediately ahead of the cabin. But the Flight Attendants repeatedly told us that those lavatories were only for business class passengers only - so why is there a signal about their availability in our cabin? Our cabin is to be using the lavatories in Economy, behind row 23.

There is a curtain at the row 9 bulkhead to separate business class (and its galley/lavatories) from premium economy. But the FAs constantly came thru the curtain; the curtain was always brushing my legs in seat 9H throughout the 9h30m flight.  it was incredibly irritating- why bother closing the curtain if they're constantly going to be ducking under it?

While on the flight I watched the movie ""A Bigger Splash"" - it was utterly bizarre, both boring and irritating, but it had the line ""Premium economy- sounds like a pen for dirty animals"". Made me chuckle. Inflight entertainment options were actually pretty good on AA's system; in addition to that move I was able to watch Absolutely Fabulous the Movie; Bad Moms, Crazy Stupid Love, and Spy with Melissa McCarthy. 

My trip home on AA 962 on November 18 came at the end of a very long day. I worked all day, leaving the office in Sao Caetano at 5:30 PM; the taxi ride to the airport took 90 minutes. The 10:55 PM departure meant several hours to spend in the Admirals Club, which was fine. Boarding was a bit confused due to ""Priority AAcess"" never being called, but there was still room for my rolling bag and backpack overhead from my bulkhead Seat 9L.  

Upon sitting down, I was handed a Premium Economy dinner menu- that had been missing on the flight down. The dinner entree choices were Salmon or pasta.  On a plane out of São Paulo? Damn straight I chose pasta. 

Once underway, there was no cocktail service; the drink offered was what I wanted to drink with dinner. Once again I got wine in a plastic cup, then was handed a dinner tray with a wineglass on it. 

Even the pasta entree came on a real plate this time... and it looked pretty and tasted amazing. Really. Also on the meal tray were a very nice meat/cheese plate, and green salad, a roll with butter, and a cake.

Breakfast was served about an hour before arrival; it was yogurt, a warm roll, and what was probably the freshest, tastiest fruit I've ever had on an airplane. I skipped the coffee this time around.

Overall AA's Premium Economy class is an upgrade from Economy (and even Main Cabin Extra), and is better than the EVA and BA Premium Economy cabins I've flown in the past 18 months (largely because the plane is newer, so has chargers and large in-flight entertainment display screens). While nowhere near business class levels of comfort, the Premium Economy cabin makes the long-haul flight more bearable!"

Secondly, the forward area used for business first was now crowded by the addition of 3 rows of Comfort Plus seating. Obviously Delta refitted this aircraft for maximum passenger numbers at considerable sacrifice of passenger comfort, especially in Business First, where the seats were ridiculous thin backed chairs, the worst I have ever seen in any airline's front section, with severely reduced legroom and pitch compared to previous standards for Business First.

The window seat on this plane is better than the isle seat since you have a pretty large extra stowage by the window, very nice. Also acts as an extra table on the side.
Service was good, but food was horrible. Among the 10 worst flight meals I have ever had. The passed a menu in the ""plus"" cabin, but it turned out they did not have anything from the menu on board.

75E on the way out felt fairly cramped, and Im only 5 7. My partner, in the aisle seat 75D, is only 5 so she had no issues with knee room.

The return flight was a revalation. We were, luckily, allocated 77J&K on the upper deck. As previously noted, by others, the overhead storage bins on the outer seats are smaller than usual, so only two cases per binbut there are additional storage bins along sides seats A & K, and these are pretty capacious.
Also due to the arrangement of the bins, if you are a bit cheeky you could nab two as 77J&K span 2 bins and two windows.

I know others have said that the media box is an issue but I found that i could stretch my legs out full along the gap between the seat in front and the outer storage bins. This may not be possible on the lower deck equivalent seat.
You also getting the feeling  of more space as you can use the storage bins as an extra arm/leg/head rest, or table space.
This seat id just two rows in front of the toilet at the rear of the section but this was not a major issue, as the four toilets , accessible from this section spread the footfall pretty well.

I would definitely pay to pre-book this 77J&K.

In-flight entertainment system was pretty good, only minor annoyance was having to view measurements either in imperial or metric, not a mixture of both that we use in the UK.
The IFE screen tilts. This is particularly useful if the seat in front is reclined.
There is a headphone socket on the inside of the arm rest. This accepts standard 3.5mm plug so you can take your favourite headset with you. BA do supply a set but I suspect that they are pretty average.

I worked out how to remove the remote control/gamepad thingy, but could I get it back into its socket!?
The trick is to feed the cable back through the hole on the right-hand side of the holster. Once all of the cable is in, the handset should snap back into the holster.

The USB is a 'traditional' slow charger, so if you have one of those new fangled Quick-charge devices you'll just have to re-learn the art of patience( wonder if the sockets in Club World are faster).

Discovered the location of the  UK 3-pin power socket. It's in between each seat. This means someone has to share as there will be one fewer that the number of seats in the row.  

However, I have had it confirmed that the UK 3-pin socket will only maintain a laptop's charge not increase it, so if you've got a flat battery that it's plain hard luck. I'll test this out later. Best advice is to fully charge and don't use sleep mode, or carry a spare battery or three."

These 2 seats are bassinet seats and I traveled in both with my 8 month old daughter recently. The bassinet is attached to the panel next to the video screen (which is essentially the back of the seat in front of you). The bassinet then sits above all the seats so your baby is quite close to the overhead bin. You have to strap your baby in, else it's quite dangerous as they could roll out and fall several feet onto the floor. The other challenge is that because the baby is so high-up, they're quite close to the lights. My little girl didn't end up sleeping in her bassinet because it was too light - but it did keep her entertained for a bit as she laid there playing with her toys and looking at the lights. So if you want to use a bassinet for sleeping, I'd recommend considering one of the bulkhead bassinet seats first.

There is one plus about these seats and that's that there is space behind seats 21D&G (center aisle) and the bulkhead so if you need to stand-up and bounce your baby, there's a convenient spot to stand that doesn't get in the way of other passengers moving around the aisles. The other option is to go to the bar area which also works well as a change of scenery and room to walk around.

@Admin - I'm not sure how traveler photos are submitted but I have a photo that shows how the bassinet looks in relation to the seat. Please let me know if there's a way to submit it. Thank you."

The seats in business class (Delta One) are torturous. Too narrow, with little padding, and simply no comfortable position no matter how many ways you try it. Using this plane for an 11 hour international flight is cynical, at best. 

The single rows are slightly better for comfort, but only in the odd-numbered seats that are not directly on the aisle. (Was in 3D on this plane two days earlier from ATL-SEA. Uncomfortable, but okay for a shorter flight)

I felt very glad that i was with my traveling companion in the middle row of two seats, as they have NO separation between the seats. I would HATE being next to a stranger in these seats. 

Additionally, the IFE screens are woefully small with TERRIBLE selection. My IPad is bigger than this screen, with better resolution. You’re  better off using the Delta app on your tablet than this ridiculous seat back screen.

There is only a partial semi-transparent ""screen"" hanging way above the last row of PE seats, Other than that there is no physical partition between PE and normal economy. This means that you get loads of leg room there. Actually way more than PE passengers have! At the same time, as it is not a bulkhead or emergency row seat, there are no limitations in stowage of your personal items for takeoff and landing. Personal viewscreens and tables are in the armrest, but this did not make the seat too narrow for me (and I'm not exactly thin at 175 cm and 100 kg). Notable feature is that in the last row of PE seats, i.e. row 25, A, D, G & K seats have monitors in the back too. The monitors have very limited functionality, so for personal entertainment you still need to use your armrest device, howver those backseat screens have working USB charging ports, which are more convenient to use than the armrest ones.

The only drawback of the row 27 seats is that remote control for personal entertainment is at the inner side of an armrest, which may lead to you pressing buttons accidentally.

First of all it is a no brainer to be upstairs at a window. 
1. It's quieter
2. You have 2FA for 20 and 2 toilets: ratios not matched downstairs
3. 2x2 not the dreaded 2-4-2
4. Big window boxes for your stuff

Aisles upstairs are bad though. First of all the overhead lockers are small and second the floor seems to be made of 2 mm thick aluminium so, being towards the centre, you rock up and down whenever a FA walks past. Being on the edge at a window reduces this oscillation.

So, what's best? Again a no brainer. 62AK and 64AK have direct aisle access. 64A in particular is a vast space because of the cot provision. It is never released even to Gold guest list members until check-in. Move like greased lightning.

Service is indeed variable. I once waited 2.5 hours for an offer of a drink during an evident 'marital' tiff between two male stewards that was clearly unprofessional. But overall they do their British best. Not Qatar or Cathay or even South African but vastly preferable to US carriers whose FA regard even premium passengers as unspeakable vermin."

Between the provided comforter and pillows, there really wasn't much space to put personal items when I first arrived.  The IFE was superb, with a large and responsive screen.

The entertainment system is very good; I found the seatback system preferable to the one on the swing-up arm of 16C, mainly because of the viewing angle and access during take-off/landing (and 16Cs gets bumped by passersby).  However, the seatback versions screen does not tilt to improve the viewing angle when the person ahead of you leans his/her seat back.

Wider armrests contribute to comfort and in fact it's difficult to hit the neighbour's elbow while seated.  The seat is hard and the amount of recline is limited; it also lacks a proper leg support, having only a foldable foot rest to offer.
For the day flight to BOS it was ok but I would not recommend it for the night flight to MUC. The limited recline and lack of leg- and lumbar support makes it uncomfortable for sleeping.  
The choice of seat linings and colours makes a very good impression, the rest of the plane's internal finishing is - under the aesthetic point of view - bland and impersonal.
There is a welcome drink, served in plastic cups and that is all about the extra service compared to eco.   The food served is nondescript at best.
There is no boarding priority nor any other perk compared to eco, however LH ground personnel was OK with me carrying both my cabin trolley and my document case on board - it may be standard policy or just kind personnel.
It's obvious how LH tries to keep a healthy distance between this class of service and the Business, and this brings to the point: is it worth flying Premium Eco? I have paid less than half than the C fare made available to me, but almost double as the Eco fare (I do not remember which).  If double the money is worth the difference, it's a question."

Plenty of room between the armrest and the wall to stash blankets and pillows.  There is a bulkhead behind the row, so no one behind to kick your seat.  Tray tables are in the armrests, so that may be a drawback for some.  There is a shared permanent drink tray in the armrest as well.

New entertainment systems were nice with a large touch screen with multiple movie and TV options, as well as other choices including flight status and maps.  There is a remote that is stored as an inset to the armrest, but the screen was responsive and I didn't need to use the remote.  

The only drawback I found was when the person in front of me reclined to sleep.  The pitch is pretty extreme at maximum recline and, paired with the immovable center armrest, made it challenging to exit the seat with the forward seat reclined.

The most striking feature is quietness and that the IFE is much better than 747-400.

However the rules of seat selection are not the same as the old 747-400! First of all the upper deck window in J is no longer my default as it was on the 747-400. The reason is that the bins (although good) are not as big. The second is that the curvature of the aircraft given the 2-3-2 layout means that there is a slightly claustrophobic feeling that is not encountered on main deck window seats. Best picks overall are 53K and 53A as they offer direct aisle access but another good (if risky) pick on flights that are not full is the middle E seat which is wider, and 53E offers direct aisle access. But not as good if the flight is full as you are trapped needing to maintain two privacy screens and not all FA approach the seat from the aisle using, instead, the intrusive button feature. 

On the main deck 15A and 15K are good picks because they are recessed and relatively private, there is direct aisle access, and also because 15B and 15J are often unoccupied. 15B and J themselves are highly undesirable for two reasons. First they are directly next to toilets. Second reason is that incomplete enforcement of cabin separation means a procession of Y class passengers come to use these toilets and loiter around waiting sightseeing at the back of J cabin which can be distracting. One other thing: the main cabin windows and the upper deck rear cabin (56 through 59) do not really offer a view of anything other than a vast wing! 

In the F cabin the suites are noticeably bigger than 747-400. 1A and 1K are very private but (as someone commented) useless for people travelling together. Neither are the centre seats particularly good for couples as they are angled widely away from each other so in practice one might as well choose 2 windows and use the companion dining feature."

Things common across 3 classes:
Each passenger is given a water bottle for the entire 11-14 hour flight. You can bring the bottle to the back and ask nicely and the cabin crew will probably refill it.

For Business class I would call it comfortable though being 5'5"" my feet are slightly cramped. Food is nice but some meals are different as Delta changes things up on one of the only two Africa flights (other from South Africa) though two of the meals wont burn your mouth at least.

Premium economy is nice especially for the extra legroom, comfortable enough to sleep about 8 hours in before being unable to sleep again. Food is not my type on this flight in economy as both food options are too spicy for anyone who isn't accustomed to the local food in Nigeria (Better to bear the spice or just ignore the hot part).

Economy seat is still easy enough for me to sleep in and doesn't feel cramped. Still same food thing applied either way.

Luckily my seat did not have the IFE box under the seat in front as this robs passengers of further legroom. The recline was ok on the seat and the adjustable headrest could be quite comfortable, if there was just another 2 inches of legroom. When the seat in front is reclined the IFE screen is in right your face. Choice of IFE was however very good. The headphone socket in the arm of the seat is very easily damaged due to the location, encroaching on your very valuable 17.5 inches and care is needed if the headphones are left plugged in when leaving your seat. I feel on any long haul flight the passengers in the window and center seat should be able to get out to use the bathroom without disturbing the other passengers in the row, a tight 31inch pitch makes this impossible. The seats are so narrow that eating next to any other passenger is very difficult as clashing elbows occur.

As for the Duo-Seats from row 55 to 58: The window seats are positioned about 6 inches away from the window, so there is no leaning against the window to find an alternative position for sleeping, but it makes the seat more spacious and you can put your pillow or backpack next to you instead of under the seat in front of you. Also the space under the seats in front of you is shared with your seat neighbor (row 56 to 58) and the space in the aisle is much bigger and people do not tend to bump into the person in the aisle seat. Over all I would say these Duo-Seats are good for two people traveling together who don't want to bother another third person. My boyfriend is quite tall and although the seats don't have extra leg room  per se, he still felt more comfortable due to the extra room in the aisle.

Menus and hot towels to freshen up were distributed to the main cabin - a nice touch.  Food wasn't terrible.

Seat: as all the exit rows, the seat is narrower than the others economy class seats. 
TV can't be used for taxi, taking off and landing. 
The duo combination for the exit row seats is great. I had a free seat next to me (67J) so i switched and spent the whole on this seat. If you can be on row 67, take seat B or J, so that you are not on the aisle. This will avoid anyone to bump onto you or your TV. Plus you will have a free space toward the side of the plane.

If you are in Economy class. Try to seat as close as you can to the front of the plane. CDG has really slow immigration where the passengers of this flight will go through. 2-4 agents for a whole A380 plane, and sometimes it takes up to an hour to go through immigration....

Storage: Above seat storage is pretty much rare. Cabin crew usually have their luggage already on storage 67. Store your carry on on one of the earlier rows if you can (65-64) rather than rows behind. Makes it easier when leaving the plane.

Bothersome: your are next to the lavatories, so there will be a bit of traffic after the meal times. But not really annoying, I had my legs stretched the whole time and people could still wait in front of me. However I wouldn't recommend the seat D and G. People are really waiting on your feet.

Food: food is okay. could be a bit more food on the plate. I have flew a lot from New Zealand and France and now i always have my own meal. I don't think any airline feed well enough unless you are in Business Class. 

A380: surely my favourite. The quietness of the plane is much appreciated. My 7 hours from Dubai to Paris were far quieter than my 17 hours between Auckland and Dubai with a 777.

The company is really good in my opinion. The crew was really friendly. Out of my many flights with Emirates i had once a bad crew member. i raised the issue to them during the flight and only communicated with the other crew members. Was much better."

Was the third time i took this flight over the last 2 months. My body type is 185 cm, 95 Kgs, athletic. Here are my feedbacks: 

Was lucky to change to an exit row from 29G to 26C. Despite the commentary that the proximity of the lavatory and galley may be a bothersome, the small amount of bothersome of the location versus the space for my legs for a 17h flight, which is entirely over night, was a really easy decision. I slept about 11h on this flight thanks to sleeping pill and was legs were not cramped when i woke up. So if you can get an exit row: DO IT.

The Boing 777 is la oud plane, so nothing Emirates can really do. Try to seat in front of the engine if you can. But noise cancelling headphones are highly welcomed.

The exit row seats are narrower than regular ones, so there is a bit more compression from the sides. The TV cannot be used during Taxi, Take off and Landing (time to read or chat with the cabin crew).

An exit row seat on the aisle can be annoying as people hit the tv often. 90% of the time they apologise but it can be annoying. 

I highly recommend to get food at the airport. I was surprised the first time, but there not much food provided during the 17h flight. And this was the case for previous flights I had taken.

There is pretty much no storage for you cabin luggage. If you don't need your cabin luggage during the flight, put it above the rows in front of you. The crew usually puts it above the rows behind you, but when you are arrived everyone wants to get out and you trying to access your carry-on that is sitting 2-3 rows behind is like being a salmon swimming against the river.

Overall: The company is great (I am Gold member), the flight is long, so yes the body is not going like it. But sleeping pills, noise cancelling headphones, good hydration will make it work. I flight back in a week this time with the A380 doing this long-haul. Looking forward to feel the difference."

From a selfish point of view, my right armrest was obviously out of play and I had to use the blanket to establish a makeshift armrest within my own seat to prevent my elbow from painfully pressing against the side of that right armrest since her fat was resting where our elbows should have been, further constraining my space. 
  That night my sleeping pills were little match for the BA design engineers' space economics calculations in the battle for comfort on this eight hour flight, yet the war is not over and I'll find my solace in the A330 business class.  Peace!"

The best thing about these seats is they are great for flying with a companion.

Wifi was great, and the TV screens are nicely shielded so you don't see much from others' screens. However, your screen is not directly forward of your gaze, which is slightly annoying. Programming is limited.

Sleeping was OK. Elbow space is cramped, there is no knee support, and the blanket is too thin. The mini cabin was also chatty on my flight beginning 2 hours from landing.

There is more leg room then you would normally get from economy, due to the position of the seat at the back of the aircraft. There was also a relatively large gap between the right side of my chair and the plane wall, so i could store odd bits and bobs like my headphones and newspaper. Handy on a long flight. It may be close to the toilets, but it wasn't close enough to cause a disturbance."

It allows you to get up easily without disturbing your neighbor even from the middle seat. The seats are wide enough that you don't feel cramped. The TV comes out of the arm and I am impressed but the responsiveness and crispness of the IFE. There is also plenty of selection including new releases and classics. A great way to spend an 8 hour day flight if you don't want to splash for Club World. Well worth the couple hundred bucks upgrade fee.

To but it in a picture, if the person infront was to recline their seat, it would be blocking a portion of your window. Nevertheless you still get great views out over the wing without have to lean forward too much. The service onboard this aircraft was nothing special, but it was everything you need.

I was in premium economy in seat 21A and my brother was seat 21B. It has the full extra recline despite being at the wall that had the emergency exit on the other side of it. Also didn't have a problem at all with seat width. One user commented that the curtain constantly hit them. Perhaps on the 787-800 but not on this plane did the curtain hit my brother once. We also never were bothered by people queuing for the toilet as they queued on the standard economy side of the curtain!

The recline is outrageously good for the price. It goes so much further than normal economy and anyone who complains is simply very hard to please! If you want business class standard then pay for it!

There was no number associated with it.

I was flying from Detroit to Lexington. I am a female about 5'5 and weigh approximately 315 lbs. Flying is hard for me.

I sat in seat 1B because it was the only one available when I booked. Although it doesn't show on the seat map, I was located in Comfort+. There was no first class options.

While my foot room was ample, I BARELY fit in the seat. It was a struggle. I had the fixed arm rests that went fully down the seat, so there was no overhang of any kind. In order to sit in this seat, you have to be able to fit BETWEEN the arm rests.

While my hips fit, BARELY, I very much hung over when it came to my arms and shoulders. I definitely took up extra space.

Let me just say that I feel SO FORTUNATE that I didn't have to sit next to anyone. There was a man who had the seat next to me. It was CLEAR that he did not want to sit next to me (I DO NOT BLAME HIM). We got very lucky and there was an open seat right behind me and he actually knew the person in the seat next to that. 

he was very kind and didn't make a big deal, but took the seat behind me. I couldn't have been happier. This was by far the smallest, most uncomfortable seat out of all the flights I had for this trip (I had a total of 4).

At the same time, however, the seat belt DID fit. I didn't need a seat belt extender, though, I had to stretch that seat belt as far as it would go. It wasn't extremely tight, just a little inconvenient to buckle. I got it, though.

If I wouldn't have been able to sit by myself, I would have felt uncomfortable and bad for the person next to me. I don't believe there was any good seat on this plane for a person my size."

Whilst BA was one of the first to introduce flat beds on Business Class, the cabins are now a bit dated. The backwards-forwards layout is a bit awkward, and the screens are relatively poor. 

On the plus side, I like the window seats - they provide a kind of mini private cabin, and 53K has the advantage of not needing to climb over someone to get out. (NB Lots of people complain about this - for me it is no great hassle as long as you are reasonably fit and agile, but probably not recommended for someone with mobility difficulties. 

If I was flying on a corporate tab, BA's offering is not as good as most major European or Asian major airlines. But often BA offers cheaper and more flexible fares in Business, and if a flat bed and sleep is the priority, BA is just fine."

With only 30 seats the WT+ cabin feels exclusive and I would choose this seat again since the curve of the fuselage gives one a ton of space to the right of the seat, as well as ample under the seat in front. There is plenty of room here for a 5'10 person such as me. Well worth the premium (only $200 or so) over Econ in my opinion. The upgraded IFE is first class, crisp screen and ultra responsive.

AA should not only be embarrassed but also fined for making passengers endure such seating.

The seats are extremely narrow, to the point where all three of us seating in the section by the window had to sit the whole journey with our arms folded, squashed up like sardines.

I am 5'11"" and my legs were in constant pain from being wedged up against the seat in front.

Another problem with this AA aircraft configuration is the very small overhead luggage bins. TOO small, or enforce the carry on size and number of bag limit; just an awful experience.

We will NOT be using this airplane or airline again. Shame as I am a platinum executive with AA by will not suffer seating like that ever again!

I flew from CDG to LAX in seat 93G and I was pleased with the seat. I liked being in the last row and close to the bathroom and Snack Bar!  I was surprised that not only did I have a USB charging port at the bottom of the TV screen, I also had a foot rest. This is a straight economy seat and I didn't expect either of those items! I am only 5'3"" so I had plenty of legroom but a tall man sitting next to me was a bit more cramped. 
The seats on this plane seem to be a bit more narrow than the average plane but it was wide enough for me. This seat does recline but the seats in economy don't recline far, which is nice for the person behind the reclining seat!  The seats sort of go back and down, like some recliners do so as not to encroach on the space behind. 
I had reserved a window seat in advance of the check in and paid $23 for the privilege but I really hadn't needed to. There were plenty of seats available when I checked in 25 hrs before takeoff.  In fact, I changed my window seat on the mail level to this one on the upper level of the plane.  With the cameras, I was able to see what I would have seen from the windows!  I would have liked to have gotten a window seat on the upper level simply for the extra storage beside the seat but I really didn't need it.  
A word about the overheads on the upper level! Those over the side seats are very small.  They are really only for coats, purses or very small bags.  Those over the center seats are bigger.  I was one of the first on the plane in the area of my seat so I did get the cabinet directly above my seat. 

ENTERTAINMENT:
The entertainment monitor offered a large selection of movies, both older and newly released. They had many in English, as well as French and German and a couple other languages.  They provide you with headphones free of charge.  There is also music, news, games and flight information.

FOOD: I was given the following:

Snack and drink soon after takeoff

Dinner: Curry Chicken, Salad, Cheese, Roll, Dessert and water.  You are also offered wine, beer, soda, juice and coffee/tea

A couple hours later, we were offered Ice Cream Bars.

Lunch: Potatoes Au Gratin, Cucumber Salad, Cheese, Lemon Tart, Roll, water

SNACK BAR:
The snack bar in the back has a variety of items. It seemed to change throughout the flight. I saw Granola Bars, Candy, Pretzels, Rolls, Ice Cream

The service was excellent with everyone being very friendly and personable.  I enjoyed the flight more than I expected and the 12 hours past relatively quickly.

This plane tends to be much quieter than the other planes I have been on. You don't hear nearly as much of the engine noise.

I would fly on this plane and with Air France again."

In this aircraft seats are pushed up against the interior of the plane body and as a result your shoulder hits the plane interior before you can comfortably center your arm over the armrest.  My guess is seats have been shifted by almost 3 inches to the exterior of the plane. I'm not sure what this changed gained but I became acutely aware of what it took away.

1. In typical Airbus fashion the entertainment system occupies significant space under seats A, B, E, and F. This prevented underseat storage of my small computer bag which fits fine elsewhere, even Regional Jets. This necessitated storage in the overhead bin.  Multiply this by the number of pax in similar situation and it places great and unnecessary demands on overhead storage.  Furthermore, the configuration resulted in very tight and uncomfortable legroom with my right leg frequently pressing uncomfortably against the metal box under the seat.

2.  The pitch between seats was too small, I'm 6ft 1in and my knees were pressing against the seat most of the flight.  My face was barely 15 inches from the seat in front of me.  Also, seat cushions are too thin.  

3.  The entertainment system didn't work (reported to cabin staff) - why even have it on aircraft operating short domestic flights?  Remove it and retrieve under seat space, reduce weight and maintenance costs.

4. Only 1 overwing emergency exit? While it may pass FAA evacuation tests, I question whether it will be effective with panicky pax unfamiliar with emergency procedures as well as cluttered and tight seat rows."

Wow, okay I like aisle seats so there is severe bias here and I just do pure economy. First time on an A350-900 and I was impressed with both the low noise (at the back of the plane, in relative terms) combined with the overall stability of the aircraft (at the back of the plane - as in, drinks don't fly around in space when you hit moderate turbulence). For a moderately-sized to smallish-framed adult, there is a reasonable/slightly-surprising level of space especially when reclining the seat (again in relative terms for an economy seat; the tall cabin adds to the perception of space). Of course, for a moderately-sized to small-framed adult, it maybe a good idea to bring an additional pillow for (your own) seat comfort. Heaps of overhead storage.

Because of this we prefer two window seats, one behind the other and because of the risk of their being no 3/4K seats and, not being Gold Exec members, being blocked from pre-booking 1A/K, we always book 2A and 3A on any 777-200ER flight."

The window is perfectly next to the seat.  The exit door slide bump is slightly in the way, but nothing that will hamper to much of your legroom. However, please note to bring a blanket or something to cover your ankles and feet.  The air coming from the bottom of the door literally froze my feet, especially my right foot. Extending my legs out fully helped somewhat, as the air seemed to just blow from the door directly under the seat, but if you like to keep your feet planted and close to you, they'll freeze.  Also the FA jump seat is directly in front of you, so if you don't want a FA staring in your face during take offs and landings, you may want to opt for seat 36A. The TV screen for the exit row are in the armrest, and when pulled out the screen is a bit far away, so bringing your own device to watch something on would be better. Everyone once in a while, the smell from the lavatory will saunter over in your direction, but its not too bad and it seemed to be only temporary.  However, this only happened toward the end of the flight, I guess once more people had used the lavatories.  If you are in 36 C or D, you have to deal with the people who stand and stretch, as the area in front of these seats are really the only area of the plane to do this.  Overall great seat, and would definitely pick it again if given the chance."

The ovehead bins on the window side extend fully laterally to the width of the seats. The bins for the middle rows are further from the aisle. During emplaning passengers subconsciously move more to the center of the plane frequently resulting in shoulder bags hitting those in seats D and G. This happened to me and I observed this on the opposite aisle  also.
The leg and foot rests don't work for this 6'1"" passenger at maximum extension they didn't touch my calf, and the foot rest when deployed lifted my thigh clear of the front edge of the seat. (wearing socks, not shoes)
 I would therefore rate all the D and G premium select seats with a caution, and make all the passengers in this section aware of the limitations of the leg and foot rests for 90th percentile height passengers."

The Seatguru comments are correct that 22 B/C have no underseat storage, but they are wrong when they say the same for 22 D/E.

If you are in the outer most seat 57A you have to climb over the person in 58B to get out during the night.
If you are in the inner seat 57B there is nowhere to even put a bottle of water when the bed is made up.
If you are travelling alone the seating configuration is very un-personnel with only a sliding shutter between you.
The flight crew have to stretch over the B seats in order to reach people in the A seats, I am sure the flight crew are not happy with this arrangement

Cons: It's one of the narrower seats I have encountered on a plane. I don't know if that's the way all the seats in the aisle are; my partner was in 11A and he did not comment on it. Both the media screen and the tray fold out of some portion of the armrest and using both together feels so awkward. There is no under-seat storage because there is a large box that covers your seat and extends halfway across 11A and 11C.11A and 11C do both have under-seat storage, if truncated.  There's also no direct overhead storage so you'll have to just find a spot in one of the other overhead bins and grab it before someone else does. The FA did help with this on our flight and even entering in Group 9, we were able to find spaces.
Other Notes: The media screen folds out from between the seats and is easy to use, once you've figured out where the button release is (it's on the side of your armrest). 11A has a good view out the window."

The interior temperature was very warm when we boarded and the overhead vent produced hardly any air movement. The air flow did not improve during the flight. Boeing could have left this feature off this aircraft. So, you are at the mercy of the flight crew to control your temperature comfort though the main HVAC system.

They have the new design of overhead compartments so allow for more storage - you put luggage in vertically. Entertainment was all free and there was a very large selection, TV, Movies, Music, Games. Rows 18 & 19 are bulkhead seats and have the monitors in the armrests and pull up and swing out. As a result, the monitors are smaller and can be bumped by passengers waiting for the toilet. Those two rows didn't look really great to me, especially row 18. My only complaint was I was a little cold in this seat, which is unusual for me. MY feet were freezing.

Both legs in WT+ (Premium Economy).
I love the old Queen of the skies and was really looking forward to the flight, in particular as this is the V1 version with WT+ seating forward of Club World.
I was to be very disappointed. This is a very, very tired old bird who BA seemingly are not investing in at all. The plastic surrounding the blind was coming away, the footrest (attached to the seat in front) did not go all the way down resulting in an uncomfortable seating position and the rest of the aircraft and area was just tatty. 
Despite BA insisting that the seat pitch is the same as the A380, it felt far more cramped, and much more like normal WT (Economy). Not helped by the Multimedia box and seat legs in exactly the wrong place to stretch out.
I feel if you pay for a service (at near-as-makes-no-difference twice the price of WT) with the word ""Premium"" in the title you should expect, well a premium product. This falls well short of the mark, so much so that our next trip across the Atlantic will be with BA's biggest rival, Virgin."

Seats 4A-4C are nicely located in the forward cabin. Lufthansa service and food was wonderful.
Some general comments about the A-350 cabin layout are in order. 
First, their lay-flat seats are pretty old school. Somewhat firmer than say United and definitely more cramped in the flat configuration that United 777 or 787 seats. The tray table is a nightmare- lots of force to pop it out of the console and a finger-crushing hinge if you are not paying attention. Really poor design and ergonomics. I'll take the pull  out tray table on the 777-300 any day. There are only two toilets in the front section, as contrasted with the 777-300 or 787-900.  Sort of an inconvenience.
Finally, the A-350 does not have humidified air, like the 787-900. It was exceptionally dry once we were at cruising  altitude.
This is a nice aircraft, but the way that Lufthansa has it fitted out in business class with somewhat uncomfortable seats definitely takes away from the positive experience of excellent cabin crew and wonderful food."

Extremely narrow compared to any of Delta's other widebody jets.  The screen was so small and burnt out from age that one had no way of watching a film to any enjoyment.  Absolutely zero storage, not even for a eReader or smartphone.  Lie-flat is questionable vs. other lie flats on newer aircraft.  On this aircraft there was still a slight slant in the angle and extremely narrow foot hold area. Worst of all for seat 1A is proximity to the lavatories.  Due to the plane's age, the plumbing in the lavatory needed maintenance and the lavatory fumes wafted back from time to time for 10 hours and 12 minutes.  Finally, there is very little overhead storage due to several oxygen tanks in the overhead bin directly over the seat.

Do not sit here if you are hoping to get a choice of foods to eat and if you don't want to wait an hour between drink service and food service.

* Odd cabin sequence on this version of the 747-8: First, Biz, Econ, Prem Econ, Econ.  Not sure why they put more econ seats inbetween the Biz and PE sections.  
* # of lavs seems to be just ok, sometimes a bit of a wait.
* No lounge access unless you are *Gold or better, or pay extra.  

Overall, I would recommend spending a few extra dollars/euros for these seats.  It compares favorably to UA and DL ""econ plus"", which is just more pitch but the same width.  Good job LH."

I was in seat 11D on my recent round trip IAH-FRA-IAH (both legs). The major deficiencies of the seat are: it is too narrow; the foot well is tiny; the foot wells of two adjacent seats are so close  that you are constantly rubbing your legs against your neighbors; there is very little room around the seat; the seats have armrests on just one side - your other ""armrest"" is the console separating two adjacent seats and the console is significantly higher than the armrest, so, if you want to rest both of your arms you are sitting in a twisted pose; the seat control panel's location is such that it is very easy to press on those buttons accidentally; my seat had a tendency to re-adjust its firmness on its own - which felt really weird. The seat 11D is close to a lavatory, so, get ready to be exposed to some strong aromas sometimes coming out of that lavatory. The lavatories in business class cabin are tiny. The service during the flight (including food and drinks) is OK. I would fly on this plane in business class only if I am not paying for the ticket.

However, on the way back all 3 seats were occupied and even with all my stuff in the overhead, there was simply nowhere for me to put my feet because of the poorly located oversized IFE box where I wanted to put my feet.  I think that BA have sited these where they are easy to get at for maintenance etc, rather than out of the way (i.e. under the floor, or further forward under the seat in front) at the expense of passenger comfort.

The Premium Economy product was good although since this is considered a domestic flight you DO NOT get upgraded meals, nor a Bose headset, like you do on International PE flights.  Not having under seat storage in front of you was not an issue because the overhead compartments in this cabin and reserved for PE customers only, so carry on space was not an issue.  For taller people, the Row 13 leg rests are useless, but for a shorter person, like my wife, it was perfect and comfortable. The infotainment TV was great and functional.  The seat width, privacy, location, and comfort were all great.

The open-suite seat design had plenty of room for a long ocean-crossing flight.  The table was large enought that it could accommodate a tablet set up on it to watch a movie with plenty of room for your meal.  There were ample power sources to charge your devices with adapters for US and UK plugs. I found the UK plugs stayed in place better than the US did, which is the case on most every plane I've flown.  The 3-prong design gives them stability that you dont get from the double-prong US plug.  The best feature of this seat was the amount of storage it had at floor level.  I was able to put both my rolling carry-on bag, as well as my shoulder bag in the closet built into the divider separating the foot well/ottoman area of the suite from the aisle, meaning I never even used the overhead storage at all.  One thing I would note on the BA A380s is that the First Class bathrooms on the lower deck, while a bit above average in size, are nowhere near as large as the two Business Class bathrooms at the front of the plane on the upper deck, which are located on either side of the stairway.

Also there was no galley in the front section near this seat - its where the stairs lead up to business class and where flight attendants have their seats. All in all a very nice, quiet, roomy seat.

IMHO, Rows 10 and 11 are the only two good/normal comfort+ rows on board.

Row 11:  The only ""normal"" economy comfort row on board. (i.e. standard legroom, windows align properly, there's no large FA seat in the middle of the row). 

Row 13: Pro - Lots of extra legroom since this is an exit row.  Con - 1).  Misaligned windows.  The window is very far back on the row; 2.) The exit door only has a small useless porthole window; 3.)  Immovable arm rest to hold TV units, but doesn't seem to diminish seat width.  Note:  There's a large FA chair in place of 13D which is more an issue for row 14 passengers.

Row 14:  Pro -Normal C+ row (windows align, standard legroom).   Con - Seat 14D has no floor storage due to a tall, fixed FA chair in front of it.  The height of the chair limits the forward view of the cabin. 14d has immovable arm rests to hold TV units, but doesn't seem to diminish seat width.

Couple this very poor seating environment with the lack of a lav that will accommodate a normal human, the lack of a moving map, and other downgrades, the total result is an experience that is the worst premium cabin on a mainline AA aircraft today (to be honest, I'd also rate it below the premium cabins on the Eagle fleet as well).

I am 6 foot 2 inches and I had probably 5 inches or more between my knees and the seat in front. Also you have a great view out of the window, although a lot of it is wing. the only downside is that the seat cushioning is very sparse for some reason ( probably for dismantling purposes as it is an exit seat), so not very comfortable for more than a 6 hour trip between LHR and JFK.

This is purely a money-earning exercise by BA who just want the max £££'s from their business class customers, and blow their comfort
- the 2-4-2 firstly means the seats are very narrow, the legs part of the seats/bed area is narrower than the seat section to accommodate the shoulders/seat of the adjacent passenger.
- the narrow part means you can't sleep on your side, if that's what you do, as there's nowhere to bend your legs
- the aisle seats are very open and exposed  to the aisle.  In mid-flight with everyone sleepign it is an obstacle course to reach the loo as people's bedding is falling off, knees, elbows and feet are sticking out and I more than once woke someone by accident (not noticing feet with dark socks on for example).  If you're in one of those seats, there is a draught every time a crew member passes - usually at a lick as they are understaffed and trying to get round everyone asap.
- the in-seat faciliites are awful.  There is one pathetic light, tucked under the lip of the partition and impossible to find except by asking a crew member.  There is nowhere to put anything.  There is a small drawer - at floor level, down by your feet.  Also by that drawer as a mains socket and a USB socket.  By your feet I reiterate.  The drawer and sockets cannot be reached if the ""bed"" is reclined in sleeping position, or even if you just have the legs-up position, watching a film or using the tray, etc
- the meal tray is pathetic - flimsy as all get-out, and not easy to fetch out from its hidey-hole
- the ""bed"" is short.  Now, I am 6'6"" and always have a small bit of trouble on any flight or sleeper train journey, but most beds are 78"" or thereabouts.  The BA 777 ones have to be somewhere between 72"" and 75"" at the most. I could nowhere near lie straight, nor due to the narrowness (as above) sleep on my side with my legs bent. Whilst I am above average height, there were plenty of other passengers somewhat crammed in to their beds, and I would imagine if you're more than say 6'1"" you are going to not be able to lie out flat, except for just 4 seats (15A/E/F/K)
- the ""flat bed"" is not.  The backrest goes nowhere near flat.
- the 2-4-2 layour means to get to the central passengers the stewards have to lean right over the aisle passenger and access via a small space provided in the partition.  Bad for the staff and bad for the aisle passenger.
- the central two passengers (centre 2 of the -4-) are shoulder to shoulder with no privacy whatsoever.  Sleeping right next to a stranger like that is, as my wife said, like being back at Brownie's Camp, in a tent.  If on the other hand it's the adjacent aisle passsenger you don't know, you spend the flight looking straight at them from not very far away at all, unless you put the screen up, whereupon the stewards can't get to you to hand you your meal.
- the piece de resistance is the obstacle course for inner 2 centre or window passengers to get out.  If the aisle passenger is sleeping you actually have to CLIMB OVER them to get out, say to the loo.  Physicaly possible (though still not acceptable!) if you've legs as long as mine, but if you're shorter, or have a gammy hip like my wife does, this is too hard and you're going to have to ""hold on"", or risk disturbing the aisle passenger"

This relates to a non-stop flight we took in a BA 787 from London to Austin in late June 2014.




My wife and I were in seats 1J and 1K. You can see the seating configuration on seatguru.com I had the window seat, 1K. Within 15 seconds of getting on board, I could tell it was going to be unpleasant.




This ended up being the worst and most miserable international flying experience in my life. A flight we took in United Economy Plus from LA to Sydney a few years ago was far better.




I had been looking forward to flying on the 787 and enthusiastically bought the Club World seats for the non-stop from Heathrow to Austin. Big mistake. In my opinion, BA has absolutely screwed up with the seat design in the Club World section and made this a horrible passenger experience.




The seat unit or ""box"" is more like a coffin. No storage space to speak of in and around the seat. No ability to regulate the air. The air in 1K is very stuffy and stale because of the box. The cabin crew has difficulty serving 1K. They have to reach across 1J. Worse yet, once the occupant of 2J extends his or her seat, you won't be able to get to the overhead storage or to the lavatory. You are trapped in 1K. Getting to the overhead is a big deal when there is no storage room in the seat unit and all of your stuff is overhead. You better pass on the wine and cocktails, too, since you won't be getting to the lavatory.




The very few positive comments I've seen about seat 1K are misleading. Yes, it is private, but I would describe the privacy as the kind you get with a coffin. Total isolation, confining and no ability to get out of the box. 




The seat is no wider than an ordinary economy seat. It is not very comfortable in any position. It just has this goofy box built around it. You better like the person in 1J because you're looking straight at them when the privacy partition is down. The partition is down for a good portion of the flight, such as when the cabin crew is doing any type of service.




This is my first and last trip on BA between London and Austin. Even though I'm no fan of American Airlines, their first and business class seating in the 777 is far superior even if it means making a stop and doing a plane change at DFW. At least you have decent storage, ability to control the air volume and access to the aisle and overhead storage.




I wouldn't take a window Club World seat on a BA 787 again if it was offered to me free. I will suggest that the middle Club World ""E"" seat in each row could be just as bad as the ""A"" and ""K"" window seats if not worse.




BA received my comments in a post-flight e-mail survey and promised to follow-up with a call. I have never heard from them."

For the international flights I always fly on the 777,  which has a somewhat similar configuration to the A321. Although the actual seat in business class is similar in the A321 and the 777, the configuration in the 777 gives each business class seat aisle access without disturbing any other passengers.

Had to book late on a lax - jfk red-eye so my upgrade request was put in really late; however, it would not have mattered as the flight was packed and none of the 18 people on the upgrade list cleared. I have only platinum status and I am sure many on the list that did not clear were executive platinum.

With that as context I am reviewing seat 11b. I do not have to pay for the premium seats and at the time of booking had selected 14D, which is an aisle seat in MCE. I decided to change seats to 11b even though it is a middle seat because it is a bulkhead seat with ample leg room. The leg room is substantial, but the width is more than slightly reduced by the tray in the armrest. The middle and aisle seats in this row have both armrests with trays and it seemed like the width was almost a full inch less. The flight was brutal with very little sleep.

One small consolation is that the armrests go all the way to the seat, which was crucial for me on this flight as the passengers on my right and left were enormous. Had the armrest been standard they would have been overflowing into my seat. Did not stop the guy in the window seat from farting all night with some of the worst smells I have ever encountered.

I really do not think that I would pay the significant premium to travel BA club again."

The British Airways crew in Club World was excellent, but and yes it's possible for passenger to lie flat on this zone (I'm 5'5"" female) but I made a little tour of third class (Premium Economy, right behind the curtain of my seat) and next time will go for that instead. Seat 13D comprises a narrow little cubicle that can be electronically made into a lie-flat seat that connects with a footstool. But if you've brought items to work on during the 10-hour flight (Kindle, small laptop, puzzle book, all of which I preferred to the IFE), there only place to store your items is in a little drawer under the seat. Accessing the drawer, the IFE screen, and the tray table all require a jumble of re-configuring the seat. In addition, someone had purchased a Business Class seat for her toddler, and the poor child was not at all happy; the crying and screaming from the child lasted for several hours, and I felt very sorry, but on the other hand, this dispelled the myth that buying a seat in Club World ensures a child-free change to sleep. Premium Economy looked more like what I was looking for: an oversize, conventional seat (i.e. no layers of panels, and more like a chair than a contraption), with plenty of recline and legroom. I wasn't impressed by the Club World food, either. The tea sandwiches were mostly big wedges of dry bread with a smear of strange-flavored filling. I ordered beef for the entrée, and it was dry, cooked well past well done. I did raid the Club World snack pantry, though, and enjoyed chips and chocolate. The Dreamliner is beautiful nonetheless: excellent air quality and overall design that reduces feeling of claustrophobia. Weather helped prevent turbulence, but 13D also contributed to a smooth flight because the seat is near the center of the plane."

Exceeded all my expectations. The seat is wide enough and the leg rest proved to be valuable during the 14hr flight. Food is served to the premium economy section separately so ignore the announcements about what's included in the meal as that's only for regular economy. Food itself was good and presented very nicely on a tray with real silverware instead of plastic and was even cleaned up as soon as I finished.

I sat in 12C, which was a Comfort+ seat. I will be honest, I was terrified because of my size.

The seat was surprisingly comfortable. I felt like it was wide enough to hold me and I didn't even interfere with the person next to me. At the same time, however, my seatmate and I got lucky and our third seatmate did not show. Since that happened, my seatmate went ahead and moved to the window seat and we had the seat between us empty.

This seat also allows you to be first off the airplane if you are in a hurry. On the negative side, the seat is really too narrow (even with the extra-large foot well) to provide proper nighttime comfort when lying flat, especially for someone of my size and bulk (Im 65 and 230 lbs).  In this regard, it is actually inferior to the Boeing 757 Delta One Seat 1B I had on two previous Pittsburgh to Paris round trips and which was somewhat wider. Also, the Boeings 767-300 I flew on both legs of my journey were sad and worn-out planes which really showed their age.  In particular, the entertainment centers were certainly not up to Delta One standards.  The incredibly small (10) screens had poorly or non-functioning touch operation to the point that I gave up on them and used my laptop and own videos for entertainment.

Imagine trying to evacuate in an emergency from a smoke filled cabin in darkness. A senior steward on the flight told me a similar configuration will be employed on the 787 which is apparently scheduled to replace the 777 on the route. Never again for this laddie. B.A. are the pitts!!"

I flew this plane To and from JFK (both on seat 29C) and on my outbound flight I was allowed to leave my bag in front of my feet but on the inbound flight the same bag was forbidden to lay there. 

This seat is very pleasant since there are no restrooms in fron of the cabin so no unpleasant sounds or people waiting in line right in front of your seat. the aisle in the smaller World Traveller cabin (rows 28-35) is also noticeable wider then the bigger World Traveller cabin in the back which also prevents the service cart from the cabin crew to bump into you. 

Now as for the legroom: if you recline your seat all the way to the back and stretch out your legs fully, you even have more space then in the World Traveller Plus seats.

Lastly: in the front of the main cabin, it does not get as cold as in the back. Even when we were flying over Canada: the people in the back all had their sweaters and blankets on, people in the front were sitting in a T-shirt.

This seat is truly one of the best seats in the best seats in WT (better then the bulkhead seats in the middle of the cabin)."

These seats were adequate for us trim people; just as well as anyone bigger would have a problem getting out past a reclined seat in front of ones row.  BA markets its premium economy seats as World Traveller Plus.  Plus for sure right as this year in the absence of any competition BA has hiked its fares for WT+ in its tired old 747s (vs Virgins newer A340s), a small and fuzzy video screen (vs Vs larger and sharper) which system packed up in the WT+ section after thirty minutes outbound, and their outrageous additional charging for pre-booking ones seat (vs Vs free choice).  Boarding at CPT was chaotic and, as we saw no reason to Ryanair stampede, we waited for the crowd to thin out.  Consequently we and another couple were last to sit in WT+.  We might as well have been invisible.  After seeing another passenger being served her second glass of sparkling (BA call it champagne) I firmly requested service and we got it.

There were no personal cold air guns and I had to get accustomed Sao Paulo-like air conditions with my autumn coat designed for the London weather on. The multimedia entertainment was very poor by both its contents (too few new films, Hollywood production only) and technical quality.

The overall quality of flight make me to think that nothing has changed on the plane since it was produced some 25 years ago. It made a big contrast to a flight of Lufthansa with the same plane, where the arrangement of places was more suiting modern standards. By some miracle they wider seats and aisles, better conditions for comfort of each passenger. The other flights with BA ever taken by me were also of great quality.

The good thing I witnessed on the board of the plane was a great job of pilots, tasty meals and very kind stewards with great sense of humor.

This plane only has two restrooms for coach, all the way in the back, to service 100 pax.  The lav in first class, which services all of eight people, is guarded to keep the riff-raff out.   There's very little room back there to stand and the crew don't like you invading their space, and do their darndest to stay back there as long as possible.

The entertainment system is basically useless because you have to pay for almost anything offered (and bring your earbuds or pay another $5 for those).  Onboard wifi is also ridiculously expensive at over $20 for the flight.  Guy next to me used his cell phone for his wireless, which I think is still against the rules.

By comparison with other F carriers there are a lot of seats upfront but overall, the 2010 upgrade is a masterpiece of understated design and quality. Service is invariably impeccable, food sometimes a bit patchy and slow. Almost always a good wine available and the trademark Laurent Perrier Grand Siecle will never cause distress. Familiarity breeds contentment.

Seats 1A and 1K as noted tend to he held back for Gold and above loyalty members or Pierce Brosnan. Although lovely, the seats are actually really quite close and really well suited in fact to couples. They are narrower at the foot end although do have the advantage of the large wardrobe in the nose. However those seeking seclusion are pragmatically referred to 2AK, 3AK and, especially 5AK (my favorites).

For couples 5EF far superior to 4EF for four reasons
1. They are wider at the foot end
2. They have greater seclusion
3. They have more 'walls' around the seat contributing to privacy
4. Those 'walls' enclose greater personal storage

This is a no brainer. 

So the obvious conclusion by exclusion is that you do not want to pay for any type of row 4 seat. Of course they are all preferable to 17E but if you are paying or using points instead of OpUps or do not have a family of four: this is a row to avoid. Least private. 4EF are particularly exposed to oncoming traffic from 123AK.

Still must say all seats better than anything in business by far except for 62AK and 64AK. See separate future report. And just impeccable service assured."

While the 772 has two lavs up front, the 773 has none at all Instead, it has two adjacent to the galley area between First and Club World. The problem with this arrangement, therefore, is that everyone in Club World -- now expanded to 56 seats -- can use either these two lavs or the four at the back of *their* section ... which are also shared with World Traveller Plus. Worsening matters still, *all* of these lavs are curtained off during the majority of each flight for which they're used, which I assume is exclusively on long-haul routes. The curtains are meant to keep each cabin darkened and quieter, but getting *through* them when they're snapped into place is a bit of a chore, particularly if one happens to be half-asleep (as I was on my recent flight). 

On whole, however, I remain impressed with BA's new First product -- which btw is effectively identical on most, if not all, of BA's long-haul jets at this point -- with one exception: seat width. At 22 inches -- only two wider than Club World, although thankfully First is spared their dreadful eight-across seating layout -- they're *far* narrower than those found on the usual global-best suspects (with Singapore and Emirates leading the way, as per usual), and even worse, they've fallen behind even their intra-European competition. Air France's new First seat is 30 inches wide, and all of Lufthansa's 744s now have the *truly* remarkable combination of a separate seat AND bed (in what used to be space for two FC travelers) -- one with a bona fide mattress, no less.

Also, I know this is a problem on all 777s, but the front of First will always have the inexorable problem of housing a galley area and, of course, the cockpit. Regrettably, this substantially reduces the feeling of privacy one enjoys on a 747, where you're either in the compact upper deck or at the very front of the lower deck, with only the plane's nose in front of you. 

Please note that I'm complaining only because the competition among the dwindling number of international carriers that have retained separate first and business cabins is fierce, and I honestly can't say I'd ever *pay* to fly BA First on a 777 given that the cost is generally double that of Club World -- which may have eight-across seating but still has flat-bed seats only slightly smaller than First's. None of this is meant to infer in any way that flying BA First, regardless of aircraft, isn't light YEARS better than transatlantic travel in particular on any American carrier or, God forbid, coach. The (albeit narrow) seats are tremendously comfortable, and BA does an especially good job of selecting its best flight attendant to provide cabin service for all First sections. The amenity kits and pajamas provided are top-notch; men receive a kit filled with products from The Refinery, London's top men-only spa. The IFE system has touchscreen capabilities -- still unusual even considering we're years into the ""tablet computing era"" by now -- and a vast array of programming options. Finally, what First lacks in privacy and lavs is certainly balanced out by its top-notch cuisine and multiple wine varietals on offer ... though admittedly they're a notch below the Krug and vintage Dom found on the likes of Singapore."

This Emirates flight was disappointing to say the least and not a patch on the Etihad flight in the same aircraft that I went on the last time I went to Dubai. 

The seats are just not very comfortable. They have three settings and, apart from the take off setting, the other two just don't do it for me. In the recline position they just don't feel right and in the sleep position they are too short (I'm only 6'-0 - not that big these days), don't recline a full 180 degrees and the hostess has to bring you a mattress. 

Whilst they were just ok for a 7 hour hop from Manchester to Dubai I wouldn't be happy on a 15 hour overnight from Dubai to Sydney. 

Anything else?

The hostesses were good but just two choices of wine and a middling food quality didn't add to this expensive experience. 

I look forward to the A380 on my return. 

I'm definitely flying Etihad next time."

Now the bad: 1) rear facing is uncomfortable at takeoff and landing; 2) there is absolutely no way to maneuver around the passenger in G when the seat is extended, so you have to step over the width of their body and hope you don't land on them; 3) the head is not really flat when the seat is extended; 4) entertainment was blah; 5) my main course was overcooked.

In a nutshell here is my thoughts on the economy options, hope this helps people:

The exit row seats are very spacious (row 21 and 20), however, they are HARD compared to normal seats as they are thin to make them light. Also, row 20 (as well as 19) has limited recline which makes it recline similar to normal economy rather than eco +. I would only buy row 20 if you really need legroom or are getting it free, same goes for row 19. 

Row 22 is STAY AWAY, its standard economy but you have econ comfort to recline extra into you...terrible terrible seat on either of the sides. Plus the bulkhead there usually has a crying kid or two. 

Row 16 is acceptable if you have something to put your feet on. You can squeeze your feet on the sides of the bulkhead poking into business. But be prepared to be jealous of business as you are only a few feet from row 9 and get to smell all their food! Ha.

In essence, I think row 21 is best if you need legroom, but the seats are hard and it gets cold. 17-18 are probably the best seats on the plane. Also, if you grab C or E in econ comfort the middle is almost always empyt (why pay for a middle seat).

Hope this helps someone."

Again without any apology, we were stuck with 91 D-E as the best alternative.

These were good seats. The seats seemed a little narrow but overall was an average economy seat with average comfort and average recline for a long-haul. I was really disappointed with the cabin. Old, outdated, all the white was yellowed. Rather shabby really."

I was very excited to take the Dreamliner and have the opportunity to fly on basically the most modern aircraft to enter service. The plane was beautiful, the crew were wonderful, as was the food and services. However, this is the end of my compliments for this seat and the dreamliner, mostly due to the seating configuration. The 9-9-9 high density config for this aircraft is a NIGHTMARE. The seats are very poorly designed and not very comfortable. In this seat, as it is an exit row, has limited space because of a piece of padding attached to the side just before the exit door. It reduces your ability to sit straight forward and have to twist into the middle seats space. This is further compounded by how narrow the seats are. Measure 17.3inches and see if your shoulders are narrower than that, if they are GREAT you will fit, if not, you will be very uncomfortable, especially if you have somebody beside you with the same or greater shoulder width. The seats are flush to the cabin wall, where other aircraft have a gap of 2-3"" from the curve of the bulkhead, NOT ON THIS PLANE. The dreamliner was designed for 2-4-2, but some airlines (such as this one) have decided to squeeze that extra seat in there. On top of that the seat pitch is only 31"" if your not in an exit row, this makes for a very uncomfortable flight. If you have legs longer than 34"" you are going to be cramped, if you have shoulders that are larger than 17"", do yourself a favour and buy a ticket in Economy Plus, or look at another airline, it JUST ISN'T WORTH IT.

The service from the cabin crew was excellent and the meals of a high standard with a good choice of dishes.
Whilst the 2-3-2 layout is possibly not the best layout, I didn't find that sitting in the window seat presented any real issues in getting out into the aisle.
Personally I tend not to bother with the in -flight entertainment (ICE) but from what I looked at on this flight it was very extensive including the live TV which was very good in keeping up with world events via BBC World
When taken in conjunction with free chaufeur drive to and from the airport for business class customers I would certainly fly with Emirates and in this aircraft again."

I thought this AA's improvement was going to satisfy me, but no! This plane was extremely uncomfortable for a 5+ hr overnight flight. Seats are narrow, the plane feels really cramped, I couldn't even stretch my legs (I'm 6 ft tall)... Besides that, the returning flight was delayed for more than 15 hours at DFW, and flying this plane after waiting that time was like a nightmare (For this leg, I decided to pay more to travel on Main Cabin Extra, and at least I could stretch my legs)... I found out MD 80's domestic-used planes were more comfortable than A319 ones... Despite the fact that DFW airport is really easy to navigate for international passengers, I'll try to avoid this plane  overall the next time I travel to the US

Suggestion: If you can't avoid flying this plane, don't choose a window seat! Instead of that, choose an aisle one, even if you have to pay more for that..."

I chose the location of the seat because of the divider behind it (so no worries about who you recline into, or pax using the seat to pull themselves up), but the layout of this plane where the aisle ""jogs"" to the side at the right rear of the Premium Select cabin meant that flight attendants frequently backed into my seat when they were moving the service carts around.  In particular on the outbound flight, the same FA must have backed (more like bashed) into my seat 4 or 5 times - I don't know if he was not used to the plane or just particularly clueless, but either way it wasn't pleasant.

I have to say, in all honesty, 30A was more comfortable than 5A. Yes a flat bed is nice and it's great to not have a seat mate, but the reality is that I could not sleep in Delta One seat. The leg space was so incredibly narrow that even my moderate sized body (I'm 5'6) felt confined. They call 'em coffin seats for a reason and it's really unfortunate because the service and food in Delta One are great but the seats in this 767 are terrible. 

Having said that, 30A was fantastic. The window seat in the exit row is considerably better than the aisle. The aisle seat has to share leg space with the cabin crew sitting in the jump seat during take off and landing. The window seat has just a tiny bit of bulkhead coming out from the exit door but it's completely negligible. I had unlimited leg space -- more than any other seat on the plane except the other exit row window seat. Trust me when I say that the exit row is MUCH better than Delta Comfort + .. I shuddered when I saw how tiny those seats were, with their nonexistent legroom. Whereas I could not get to sleep in the Delta One ""bed"", I slept a good 3-4 hours in 30A.

The only bad thing about this seat is that it got incredibly cold. I knew this going into it, so I made sure to have multiple layers.. but even with THREE layers on my legs and two pairs of socks, my feet were still cold. And this was a daytime flight.. My recommendation would be to bring whatever socks you wear in the arctic, in which case you will be fine. But truly, even with the frigid air, 30A is still the best seat on the plane and that says a lot about the plane."

The upper-deck mini cabin is extremely private. Leg room is ridiculously spacious - a couple of meters due to 95K being an exit row. Seat width was also great - although the wall curves in (so no side storage) there is still a small ledge on the where I was able to store my headphone case, toiletries bag and a few other small items. The right arm rest also folds up to give extra elbow room. I would highly recommend this over the aisle seat (95H) due to the extra elbow room and storage (95H has no storage). There is a single toilet in this cabin however when it was occupied I simply walked downstairs to use one of the 4 additional toilets available at the bottom of the stairwell (as such I never had to wait during the entire 10 hour journey). I also walked the entire length of the downstairs deck to explore the other cabins (including premium economy) and would highly recommend the upper deck compared over any of the other sections (excluding premium economy which was indeed quite private spacious at the front of the lower deck). The only downside is overhead storage on the sides (rows A,C and H,K) is VERY small (akin to a regional flight - good luck trying to fit in anything larger than a laptop case or large handbag). However, the center-row overhead storage is normal size so I was able to utilize the center bins for my (medium size) overnight bag. Others who did not have priority boarding though ended up storing their bags in the business class bins in front of the mini-cabin - the Lufthansa crew were very helpful with this though so it wasn't any issue, plus as the entire upper deck exits from the same front exits there were no problems for folks grabbing their luggage from the business cabin as they exited."

Seats are hard, with little padding, extremely limited recline for First Class seats, tray tables in seat arms take inches from your seat.  The worst thing was the front row view of the galley and all the noise.  When cabin staff bent over to do something in the kitchen, their butts literally encroached into my seat area.  Also, those waiting for the lavatory hung out with their butts in my face too.  There was no curtain for that area.  So lights, food smells, the socializing and activities of the cabin staff and lavatory waiters were completely disturbing throughout the entire flight.

However, my enthusiasm soon waned! 

I was in window seat 27A and my gripes were as follows:-

1. I couldn't comfortably extend my left leg straight out in front of me, due to an obstruction caused by the base structure of the seat in front. I therefore had to sit with a twisted posture!

2. They seem to have changed the design of the WC doors, so instead of having soft closing concertina type doors, they now have single section doors that close with a loud thud. Very annoying if you're sitting next to the WC where I was!

3. Generally I felt that BA have crammed far to many seats in width ways with a 3x3x3 configuration in economy class. My window seat consequently seemed to be tucked up as close to the fuselage as they could get it, so it felt very cramped. On my return journey in a small Airbus, there was at least some 3"" of clearance between the seat and the fuselage, which felt much better.

4. By far and away the biggest issue for me however, was something not related to seat comfort. Right from the moment the tug started pushing the plane back until we were airborne with flaps fully retracted, there was this excruciating whine percolating throughout my area of the cabin. I had to put my fingers in my ears at one point to get some respite from the noise!

I suspect it had something to do with the flap hydraulic systems, because the same noise started again when the flaps were extended for landing and didn't stop until retracted again at the terminal. Very annoying!! Come on Boeing :-(

In summary then, I felt the whole Dreamliner experience was very disappointing and frankly I couldn't wait to get off. Just as well we flew back on an Airbus and no, before anyone asks, I'm not anti-Boeing, I love their aircraft normally."

I chose this flight for convenience (I live in San Diego and needed to go to London for business). Upon entering the business class (Club World) cabin I was immediately reminded that all business class cabins are not created equal. BA should be embarassed by the business class (Club World) experience they provide. The 2-4-2 seating arrangement makes for an extremely crowded cabin. The flat beds should be a plus but, in most rows, four of the eight passengers (those in the window and center seats) must climb over sleeping fellow passengers to get access to an aisle. My aisle seat was left me feeling exposed and felt as if the seat had been tacked on to the center seats as an after-thought to increase revenue. The IFE screen was a small 10"" with a grainy picture quality and the headphones were extremely uncomfortable because they were too small to fit around the ear and so smashed the ear to the head. The food service appeared to have been designed for cost savings and the convenience of the crew and so came off feeling very much like coach. The main course filet of beef was miserably flavorless and over-cooked. And aside from the packaged sweets and chips, the food in the self-service area of the galley was uniformly stale to the point of being inedible. By contrast, my return flight on American Airlines was positively heavenly. Same model aircraft (777) but with a roomy 1-2-1 seating layout; all with direct aisle access. The IFE had a crystal clear 15"" screen and the excellent noise-canceling headphones were sized to surround the ear rather than smash it. The quality of the food service towered above BA. The main course beef filet was done to perfection and delicious."

Yes, the exit door protrudes a bit, but it's much less bothersome than having a seat in front of you. You can get up without disturbing two other people any time you want. The seat armrest is solid because of the tv screen, but that at least stops larger people from squishing you in.

1.  At seat 15D, when anyone from business class opens the business class toilet, or when anyone from coach opens the coach toilet, the light shines directly on seat 15D.  Very annoying.
2.  On our southbound flight there were two infants and one toddler in the business class section about three rows ahead of us, all in the same row.  This is madness.  The ladies caring for these children were up and down all night, and I have no quarrel with them, except for the fact that they kept standing ON THE SEATS and climbing over the partitions between seats.  Why the flight attendants permitted this I will never understand.  I also do not understand why American would permit crying, screaming and running infants and toddlers in this section.  Had I paid the full price of over $6,000.00 for this seat I would have been seriously upset.  These babies belong in the coach section, where a bassinet or some other sort of crib can be set up for them.  Please American, do what Singapore Airlines did and do not permit children under the age of 16 or 18 in the business class section."

The aisle next to you is where the fairly long queue for the bathroom forms.

We were seated in the window and aisle. None of the armrests lift so there is no gain in space even by the window. As soon as we were allowed to move the two passengers in front of us reclines fully and promptly went to sleep. We were literally pinned into our seats all night while they expelled foul gas in their sleep. I had to use the bathroom 4x during the flight and inorder to get out I reclined my seat fully, and got chastised by the man behind me; then I rolled over onto my stomach, inched up on my seat to my knees and then had to straddle the middle armrest ( about 6"" ) one leg at a time to exit the row. Luckily I didn't have to wake my husband as he couldn't get comfortable enough to sleep. The flight attendants were so busy, we never caught one to have them intervene so we just endured the flight from hell. In addition to the farty pants in front, there was an airsick passenger opposite my husband adding to the cabin pollution and the man behind me snored, open mouthed all night and had hallitosis. That cabin smelled dreadful. The cabin is small, cramped and cannot be called 'premium' by any suggestion. Several calls to BA customer service resulted in holding on for long periods then being cut off. Ultimately 3 days later and many attempts I finally reached someone who said she would report my comments, but BA does not do more than that. I was offered an upgrade to Club World for about $12K. How special! BA should not allow the seats to recline so far back that it becomes the responsibility of a passenger to consider if their seat will squash someone. I think it's fair to assume the airline has measured out the space to be comfortable. A little air circulation would have been helpful too, but you have no control over that in PE.
Caution: Do not fly unless you get the front row, and then be considerate of your neighbors!"

The seat itself was big, comfortable and had ample space for the legs. There are two things I found this selection offered that made this a perfect choice for me; One is that the inner arm rest goes up, and two is that you have a special compartment to your left (underneath the window) where you can store things like your purse, laptop, food, or anything at all really. I thought this was great as I placed my purse, boots and other things that allowed me to keep the space in front of me free to use for my feet, this compartment also closes, and since the armrest goes up, I was able to place my pillow on there and rest comfortably. Now this may be a coincidence or the fact that people have read bad things about this seat, but the seat next to me was empty, so I got to enjoy a long flight from Miami to France with ample room.

I had paid to select an aisle seat in the centre section when I made my booking and since he was on basically the same seat I agreed. I found the seats comfortable with plenty of knee room while the seat in front was up. A little less when the seat was reclined. There was plenty of foot space under the seat in front. While I thought the seats were wide enough, I did think that the aisles and the arm rests were a little narrow. My elbow stuck out in to the aisle and was bumped heavily twice. Strangely, I liked the fact that the seats had limited recline. I was not a problem for me and it meant that I didn't have to limbo to get out of my seat. One gripe is that there is a lot of spring in the seat backs. Given that the large gentleman in the seat in front of me was incapable of moving without leaning heavily on the seat back, I did experience some close encounters with the seat back. I understand the gripes of other people, but this is the future of long haul travel, I'm afraid.

The Premium economy section is small, and feels fairly exclusive although the airline doesn't appear to curtain off either business up front or economy behind. 
The seat itself is large, wide and with plenty of legroom. I am 5'10 and it would be ample for anyone much taller I fancy. The leather seat is very comfortable for this 8 hour flight and there is plenty of space to store odds and ends that you tend to gather around yourself to make these flights go faster. There is power at every seat but it takes some finding - down at the back of the seat and hidden away a little. There is also a USB on the large IFE screen. On that matter, there is a large screen, working well as a touch screen and very clear. There is also a ton of choice on movies but I thought the audio selection was very poor but such things don't matter too much to me.
Service was pretty good. Not super friendly, but efficient and there when you want it. The response to my call button press was very fast (under a minute) and that is unusual and welcome. 
The 787 is a lovely plane - quiet and airy with very good lighting that changes as the light outside changes. I have had my issues with AA in the past but this is a great value option - I wouldn't spend a fortune on Business across the pond but this is a really good option I think."

Given that a route this short (ORD-DTW) would often be on a tiny regional jet, this was far more comfortable and offered wifi and streaming entertainment to passengers' devices. More storage and room than a regional jet and a quieter ride. Far more cushioning in the seats than the United flights I've taken lately.

Any taller and your knees buckle and very uncomfortable. The bulkhead means you cannot put your feat under seat in front to marginally less leg room. Unlike many Premium Economy cabins. bathrooms are all the way at the back of the plane. On other configurations, Premium Economy has dedicated bathrooms. This means walking through curtained area to back of plane and incurring wrath of Economy passengers who do not realize you have no bathroom. Also, difficult to time bathroom runs as close to 30 rows of people can pop out in front of you. Seat itself quite nice and good width but don't expect to be able to sleep if you are greater than 5'6"" as limited recline and useless leg rest mean getting comfortable not easy. 

I had no issues with arm rest monitor and passenger in 10A able to get past me with no disturbance. Nice not to have reclined seat in front of you.

Cabin overall quiet and less disturbance than Economy plus wider seats and a few inches more leg room.

I'm 5'9"" and my husband, who was in the middle, is 6', and we were both miserable on this flight. We both have had back surgery, and sitting feeling like you're pitched forward with zero lumbar or cushion support is awful even for a short flight. I cannot imagine flying long haul on it, but I would pay double for another airline with better seats. It's sad because we generally like AA even though most don't, but this plane (even for a 1 hour flight) is just ridiculously bad. Luckily no one reclined into me, but if they had I probably would have come close to a panic attack because it was already way too tight in the seat. Skip this plane if at all possible, especially if your flight is lengthy."

While serving breakfast, I told her what I wanted and even showed the item that I wanted from the menu. To my disgust, she said she cant see what I had pointed to, and even said she cant understand.
When the chief steward brought the buns, I chose 1 but changed my mind and took another 1. He raised his voice telling me to also take the 1st bun since he said its already been touched. If you dont want the passengers to touch the bun, why cant you put the bun on the passenger side plate using tong after the passenger has pointed to the bun that he wants?

The seat was comfortable. I sat in 77K outbound and 76K on the return flight. I selected these seats for no charge because I'm an elite class flyer. I chose the upper deck because of its 2-4-2 configuration instead of 3-4-3 on the lower deck. The cabin I was in was relatively small cabin with lavatories at both ends. The only time there was a wait for the lav was right after meal service. The small cabin also kept things quiet, and this is the quiestest, smoothest aircraft I've ever flown on. Please know that seats 76K and 77K have the AVOD boxes in the foot area, prohibiting use of the space to store my backpack. And know that the outer overhead storage bins are small and do not accommodate regular-size roller bags easily. The center section overhead bins do accommodate bags like these easily, however. One bonus for 76K and 77K is the  extra storage bin between the seat and the outer wall of the plane.

The entertainment system is old - screens smaller and coarser than more recent systems. We used to fly Business  on and off in Eva but their seats were not flat and we kept sliding down. NOW Eva have updated their business seats on the LHR-BKK route and they are not much different to BA FIRST class on some of its routes. Eva have 1+2+2 herringbone arrangement - flat beds, no contortions to get out - and business fares more reasonable than BA so  after our next trip to Bangkok we can give review of Eva business seats.

Therefore you have not the feeling of being in a huge airplane. Behind you there are 4 to 5 rows of standard economy class, but this is no problem at all, since they have their own toilette.
So, overall there is no big traffic in this section, and especially toilettes are not bothering you at all, which I find very convenient.

Seat is very comfortable, since the hardness of the seat is adjustable, and 180°-recline gives me a good sleep.
What I have noticed from other passengers: all window-seat have big advantage compared to the other seats:
You have much more storage-room beneath the window (compared to all other seats), and the (very tiny) space for your feet (when 180°-reclined) you dont have to share with your neighbor (compared to the middle-seats), means no knee-bumping.
In summary, I will only chose window-seats, when travelling in biz of LH A380.

The food was nice, many variants you can select from, service was rather quick, and the flight-attendances are really friendly and thoughtful.
Seats are equipped with Bose-noise-cancelling system, small version. This is only a very little detail, but worth mentioning, because it changes the acoustic experience during your travel dramatically.

Note: take care of your belongings when adjusting your seat; it may happen, that mobile-phones etc. can fall down through the space between the movable parts of the seat (and there is very much movement, when you fully recline your seat! Its ballet-like to watch all seat-parts change their position until the flat-bed is ready). You need assistance, if you want to have it back."

Checking with the gate agent or SkyClub concierge is more reliable, and especially for us taller ones, many of those staff (less so at the larger hubs for Delta, perhaps as their supervisors are looking over their shoulders more often I suppose) they'll override it and assign it to you before the hour prior to departure if you're courteous and polite. The staff really make flying Delta a pleasure, from check in to picking up your bag before you head home at the end of the trip.

With my legs up, there's still a good 18-24"" until the bulkhead.

More important that the bizaar seat design was the complete lack of service in this part of the plane.   All the service comes from a galley two section forward.   The flight attendants never bother to come this far back in the section.   For the 10 hour flight, I was offered one cocktail, one glass of wine, and one glass of water.   Period.

It's a long time since I flew BA Club World.  A recent BA flight from Muscat means I wilI not be repeating the experience in the near future.
The cabin layout is appalling.... 2-4-2 (compared to most airlines 1-2-1) is a joke. It is cramped and one has to ask if it was designed by the bean counters rather than customers. Not surprisingly there is absolutely no storage space. It feels like flying in a coffin !  I feel sorry for the Cabin crew having to lean over other passengers to serve food and drink. I understand the A380 layout is identical so obviously BA haven't learnt by their mistakes.
My meal was inedible (tenderloin of beef, a misnomer if ever there was) and when I returned it untouched the embarrassed crew member explained it had come out from Heathrow on the outbound flight.... no wonder it was tired and tough. My camel biryani in a local restaurant the night before was succulent and tender in comparison.
And they demand £300 to book seats !  
A quick look at TripAdvisor or Seat Guru confirms that my experience was not unusual.
So sad to think BA really was once 'the world's favourite airline'
I challenge Mr Walsh to fly Emirates and then attempt to defend his substandard product. If you have to fly BA choose Premium Economy.... the cabin and seating is much more attractive and you'll save money.... otherwise use their alliance members or Emirates/Qatar/Lufthansa/Singapore."

In lie flat position the seat turns into a decent bed, but its SHORT. I’m 187 cm (6’2) tall, and I couldn’t lie on my back with my feet straight. Had to bend or lie sideways. I’ve flown business before on AA and Iberia and had no problem lying with feet stretched all the way, so this was very disappointing.  
Service was good, so was the food.
But this 8 seats across configuration is the worst business class ever. Whoever invented it and whoever approved it should spend the rest of their days seating in those seats. Crammed up, unsafe, no privacy. I booked this ticket because it was the cheapest business class fare I could find. You get what you pay for.
Oh, and BA’s first class? That’s a business class seat on AA and many other airlines. It’s funny how sad BA is. They’ll FINALLY get their business class up to par with the rest of the industry later this year, but it’ll take years before all its planes will have it. Until then- no BA business class for me.

First time on the AA A321 Transcon.  Some key thoughts:

-Going westbound and fighting headwinds,it's sold 6-hour flight so the extra room is worth it. The seat does indeed lie flat.  The pillows are average, and the blanket is well-above average.  The complimentary Bose noise canceling headphones are dynamite and work fine.

-This is a full lie-flat seat.  It's business class, but feels much like an int'l first-class seat for sure.

-We received options of champaign, OJ, or water before takeoff, plus a menu.  Three options were a cheese/fruit plate, Chicken Sliders, or Crab cakes.  Hot rolls were included and replaced when needed.  Ice cream was included as well.

-Screen is very large, though takes a while to learn how to use, but terrific option of movies, music, HBO, maps, in-flight info with multi-views.

-We had 2 FA's for the business section and it really felt like a private cabin.    Lots of drinks and snacks.

-I'd give an A+ to the seat.  For a flight of 6+ hours, it's worth it. (I'm 6-1, 185) so a bit above average, but you can lay on your side...privacy from other person, and nice ottoman area for your feet.

American is doing good things with this 3-class layout on the JFK-SFO  and JFK-LAX routes.  It was a full plane, but didn't feel like it whatsoever."

First, I want to reiterate earlier comments about the seat being cramped for a business class seat: a regular coffin.  There's an arm rest on the right that raises and lowers, but I couldn't get mine to raise.  The lowest volume level on the entertainment system was too loud.  Headphones are billed as noise cancelling, but they're not.  Beyond that, my wife and I both had the beef filet for lunch, and it was atrocious.  Have you seen those golf balls with the core made of what looks like tightly packed rubber bands?  Well that core is about the best description that I can give for that meat.  Finally, the crew was the most focused that I've seen in ages; focused on looking straight ahead so as not to accidentally see a passenger trying to get their attention.  Once, my wife was actually waiving her arms to catch the attention of one attendant, who walked right by her.  In their defense, the layout of the seats makes it impossible to serve the window or middle passengers smoothly."

Economy AND Business class seats are arranged the same way, same pitch, with extremely limited recline. Rows are packed in so close that if you do recline your seat and although it is a very limited recline, the person behind you cannot stand upright, making it extremely difficult for one sitting in a window seat to exit the row. On a couple of occasions, I was asked to bring my seat back to the upright position when food service started to allow the person seated behind me to use their tray table.

That was in Economy. So when I received an email from Air France asking me if I wanted to upgrade to Business Class for an additional $440 one way, and with me being 6'3"" tall, wanting as much legroom as I can, I jumped on the chance thinking I'd be better off in business. WRONG... As it turned out, Business Class seats are the same width, same pitch and same recline as Economy, and same 3+3 seat set up (3 seats on each side of main aisle) with the only difference being that the middle seat in Business class is left unoccupied. This does provide some relief in that one can lift the armrest and encroach upon a part of the middle seat, but still with no recline to speak of, you are still sitting upright for the entire 4 1/2 hours red-eye flight (departs at 1:25 am and arrives shortly after 5:00 am). Please note that you cannot lift the armrest in the very first row, and don't assume that the 1st row is a bulkhead and therefore it provides some added leg room because it doesn't!

Lastly, and while you might notice a slight improvement in the meal service between Business and Economy, and yes, you do get an amenities kit (toothbrush, toothpaste, ear plugs, basic sleep mask, socks in a decent bag to hold everything, there is no InFlight Entertainment... Not even a couple of overhead monitors to play the safety instructions.

So is the Business class upgrade worth the $440 added fee I paid? Not a chance... I would put a $100 value on it... Not a penny more!"

Huge mistake.  First problem: seat cushion is not exactly flat. In other words, when butt is seated cushion inclines towards a direction making my body slightly incline. Result: I got minor back pain after 10 hours of journey in that seat.  Second problem: seat recliner button was not working. I tried to manually force the seat to go backwards but did not help. I slept in the upright position in that 10 hour journey. Third problem: entertainment system. Screen of my entertainment system was fuzzy and non-responsive to touch gestures. Any video I watch gets stuck and I had to get out of that video and get back in to watch it again.

The overhead A/C unit is very loud, however, this is more noticeable on the ground.  Once airborne the noise tends to blend in with the outside air noise.  The location of the galley is also very disturbing, especially if on an overnight flight and you wish to sleep.  There is a lot of activity going on there, and it's hard to miss the noise even with earplugs or the Bose headphones.  That being said, the seats in Business are an unbelievable improvement over their previous product.  Also note that the Business Class restrooms near the front of the cabin (by the galley/walk-up bar) are much nicer than the Business Class restrooms at the rear of the cabin.  The ones in the rear are standard economy style, even though they are clearly part of the Business Class cabin."

In San Jose there is a SkyTeam lounge  no access for Delta passengers though. In a 5+ hours flight, flatbed seats should be standard. There was 1 meal served: breakfast , with a choice of ""granola"" (think Kellogg's) or eggs with tomatoes. Service was ok. There was no amenity kit. Not impressed.

When checking in online, only 2 of the 10 seats where booked  you could chose a seat when buying the ticket. At flight, all 10 seats were occupied. So it's rather an upgrade gimmick for frequent flyers than a genuine business class experience. Certainly not a ""first class""."

However, the A350 of Lufthansa is really bad: The seats are ultra narrow and the seat-configuration with 3-3-3 is a pain. OK, I understand that with steadily decreasing airfare prices, they have to add another seat per row, but this is really, really, narrow now. The situation could have been made a little better if they had chosen 2-5-2 seat configuartion rather than 3-3-3. Then, there would at least have been only 1 really bad ""double-excuse-me"" seat per row (the middle one) and not 2 of them (the ones at the windows). In addition, the person sitting in the middle could distribute the ""excuse me""-s to the left and right of the seat, not having to disturb the same people every time, he/she must get up. This alone would add to the comfort in Economy without any additional costs for Lufthansa.
In summary: this (and the B787) is the worst aircraft to be on at present! Fly the A340 if you can chose (it still has the 2-4-2 seat config)."
